@defun DESOLVE ([eq1,...,eqn],[var1,...,varn])
where the eq's are
differential equations in the dependent variables var1,...,varn.  The
functional relationships must be explicitly indicated in both the
equations and the variables. For example
@example
(%i1) 'DIFF(F,X,2)=SIN(X)+'DIFF(G,X);
(%i2) 'DIFF(F,X)+X^2-F=2*'DIFF(G,X,2);
is NOT the proper format.  The correct way is:
(%i3) 'DIFF(F(X),X,2)=SIN(X)+'DIFF(G(X),X);
(%i4) 'DIFF(F(X),X)+X^2-F(X)=2*'DIFF(G(X),X,2);
The call is then DESOLVE([%o3,%o4],[F(X),G(X)]);
If initial conditions at 0 are known, they should be supplied before
calling DESOLVE by using ATVALUE.
(%i11) 'DIFF(F(X),X)='DIFF(G(X),X)+SIN(X);
                        d         d
(%o11)                   -- F(X) = -- G(X) + SIN(X)

(%i12) 'DIFF(G(X),X,2)='DIFF(F(X),X)-COS(X);

(%o12)                   --- G(X) = -- F(X) - COS(X)
                          2        dX
                        dX
(%i13) ATVALUE('DIFF(G(X),X),X=0,A);
(%o13)                                A
(%i14) ATVALUE(F(X),X=0,1);
(%o14)                                1
(%i15) DESOLVE([%o11,%o12],[F(X),G(X)]);
                X                            X
(%o16) [F(X)=A %E  - A+1, G(X) = COS(X) + A %E  - A + G(0) - 1]
/* VERIFICATION */

                  X       X      X                X

@defun IC1 (exp,var,var)
In order to solve initial value problems (IVPs) and
boundary value problems (BVPs), the routine IC1 is available in the
ODE2 package for first order equations, and IC2 and BC2 for second
order IVPs and BVPs, respectively.  Do LOAD(ODE2) to access these.
They are used as in the following examples:
@example
(%i3) IC1(%o2,X=%PI,Y=0);
                         COS(X) + 1
(%o3)               Y = - ----------
                              3
                             X
(%i4) 'DIFF(Y,X,2) + Y*'DIFF(Y,X)^3 = 0;
                       2
                      d Y      dY 3
(%o4)                  --- + Y (--)  = 0
                        2      dX
                      dX
(%i5) ODE2(%,Y,X);
                 3
                Y  - 6 %K1 Y - 6 X
(%o7)            ------------------ = %K2
                        3
(%i8) RATSIMP(IC2(%o7,X=0,Y=0,'DIFF(Y,X)=2));
                     3
                  2 Y  - 3 Y + 6 X
(%o9)            - ---------------- = 0
                         3
(%i10) BC2(%o7,X=0,Y=1,X=1,Y=3);
                 3
                Y  - 10 Y - 6 X
(%o11)           --------------- = - 3

@defun ODE2 (exp,dvar,ivar)
takes three arguments: an ODE of first or second
order (only the left hand side need be given if the right hand side is
0), the dependent variable, and the independent variable.  When
successful, it returns either an explicit or implicit solution for the
dependent variable.  %C is used to represent the constant in the case
of first order equations, and %K1 and %K2 the constants for second
order equations.  If ODE2 cannot obtain a solution for whatever
reason, it returns FALSE, after perhaps printing out an error message.
The methods implemented for first order equations in the order in
which they are tested are: linear, separable, exact - perhaps
requiring an integrating factor, homogeneous, Bernoulli's equation,
and a generalized homogeneous method.
For second order: constant coefficient, exact, linear homogeneous with
non-constant coefficients which can be transformed to constant
coefficient, the Euler or equidimensional equation, the method of
variation of parameters, and equations which are free of either the
independent or of the dependent variable so that they can be reduced
to two first order linear equations to be solved sequentially.
In the course of solving ODEs, several variables are set purely for
informational purposes: METHOD denotes the method of solution used
e.g. LINEAR, INTFACTOR denotes any integrating factor used, ODEINDEX
denotes the index for Bernoulli's method or for the generalized
homogeneous method, and YP denotes the particular solution for the
variation of parameters technique.
