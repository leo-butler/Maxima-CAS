@node Introduction to Bug Detection and Reporting
@section Introduction to Bug Detection and Reporting
Like all large programs, Maxima contains both known and unknown
bugs. This chapter describes the built-in facilities for running the
Maxima test suite as well as reporting new bugs.

@defun run_testsuite ()
@defunx run_testsuite (boolean)
@defunx run_testsuite (boolean, boolean)
Run the Maxima test suite. Tests producing the desired answer are
considered ``passes,'' as are tests that do not produce the desired
answer, but are marked as known bugs.

@code{run_testsuite ()} displays only tests that do not pass.

@code{run_testsuite (true)} displays tests that are marked as known bugs, as
well as failures.

@code{run_testsuite (true, true)} displays all tests.

@code{run_testsuite} returns @code{false}.
@end defun

@defun bug_report ()
Prints out Maxima and Lisp version numbers, and gives a link
to the Maxima project bug report web page.
The version information is the same as reported by @code{build_info}.

When a bug is reported, it is helpful to copy the Maxima
and Lisp version information into the bug report.

@code{bug_report} returns an empty string @code{""}.
@end defun

@defun build_info ()
Prints out a summary of the parameters of the Maxima build.

@code{build_info} returns an empty string @code{""}.
@end defun
