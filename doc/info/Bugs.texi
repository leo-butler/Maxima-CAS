@node Introduction to Bug Detection and Reporting
@section Introduction to Bug Detection and Reporting
Like all large programs, Maxima contains both known and unknown
bugs. This chapter describes the built-in facilities for running the
Maxima test suite as well as reporting new bugs.

@defun run_testsuite ()
Run the Maxima test suite. Tests producing the desired answer are
considered ``passes,'' as are tests that do not produce the desired
answer, but are marked as known bugs.

run_testsuite() takes two optional arguments, show_known_bugs and
show_all. Both arguments are booleans. By default, only tests that do
not pass are individually displayed.

run_testsuite(true) displays tests that are marked as known bugs, as
well as failures.

run_testsuite(true,true) displays all tests.
@end defun

@defun BUG_REPORT ()
Prints out Maxima and Lisp version numbers, and gives a link
to the Maxima project bug report web page.
When a bug is reported, it is helpful to copy the Maxima
and Lisp version information into the bug report.

The version information is the same as reported by BUILD_INFO.
@end defun

@defun BUILD_INFO ()
Prints out a summary of the parameters of the Maxima build.
@end defun
