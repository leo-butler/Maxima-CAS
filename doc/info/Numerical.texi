The following is obsolete and does not exist in Maxima 5.9.  We leave
the documentation here for historical purposes.

To make an interface to fortran
libraries in the current MAXIMA look at the examples in
"maxima/src/fortdef.lsp"
 - The IMSL version of Romberg integration is now available in
Macsyma.  For documentation, Do PRINTFILE(DCADRE,USAGE,IMSL1); .  For
a demo, do batch("dcadre.mc");
This is a numerical integration package using cautious, adaptive
Romberg extrapolation.
The DCADRE package is written to call the IMSL fortran library routine
DCADRE. This is documentation for that program. Send bugs/comments to
KMP
To load this package, do 
@example
  LOADFILE("imsl")$
@end example
For a demo of this package, do
@example
  batch("dcadre.mc");
@end example
The worker function takes the following syntax:
IMSL_ROMBERG(fn,low,hi)
where fn is a function of 1 argument; low and hi should be the lower and
upper bounds of integration. fn must return floating point values.
IMSL_ROMBERG(exp,var,low,hi)
  where exp should be integrated over the range var=low to hi. The result
  of evaluating exp must always be a floating point number.
FAST_IMSL_ROMBERG(fn,low,hi)
  This function does no error checking but may achieve a speed gain over
  the IMSL_ROMBERG function. It expects that fn is a Lisp function (or
  translated Macsyma function) which accepts a floating point argument 
  and that it always returns a floating point value.
           
Returns either
 [SUCCESS, answer, error] where answer is the result of the integration and
  error is the estimated bound on the absolute error of the output, DCADRE,
  as described in PURPOSE below.
or
 [WARNING, n, answer, error] where n is a warning code, answer is the answer,
  and error is the estimated bound on the absolute error of the output, DCADRE,
  as described in PURPOSE below. The following warnings may occur:
     65 = One or more singularities were successfully handled.
     66 = In some subinterval(s), the estimate of the integral was accepted
          merely because the estimated error was small, even though no regular
          behavior was recognized.
or
 [ERROR, errorcode] where error code is the IMSL-generated 
   error code. The following error codes may occur:
     131 = Failure due to insufficient internal working storage.
     132 = Failure. This may be due to too much noise in function 
           (relative to the given error requirements) or due to an
           ill-behaved integrand.
     133 = RERR is greater than 0.1 or less than 0.0 or is too small
           for the precision of the machine.
  
The following flags have an influence upon the operation of IMSL_ROMBERG --

ROMBERG_AERR [Default 1.0E-5] -- Desired absolute error in answer.

ROMBERG_RERR [Default 0.0] -- Desired relative error in the answer.

Note: If IMSL signals an error, a message will be printed on the user's
        console stating the nature of the error. (This error message 
        may be supressed by setting IMSLVERBOSE to FALSE.)

Note: Because this uses a translated Fortran routine, it may not be
        recursively invoked. It does not call itself, but the user should
        be aware that he may not type ^A in the middle of an IMSL_ROMBERG
        computation, begin another calculation using the same package,
        and expect to win -- IMSL_ROMBERG will complain if it was already
        doing one project when you invoke it. This should cause minimal
        problems.

Purpose (modified version of the IMSL documentation)
----------------------------------------------------

DCADRE attempts to solve the following problem: Given a real-valued 
function F of one argument, two real numbers A and B, find a number

DCADRE such that:

@example
|   / B               |        [                              | / B      | ]
|   [                 |        [                              | [        | ]
|   I F(x)dx - DCADRE | <= max [ ROMBERG_AERR, ROMBERG_RERR * | I F(x)dx | ]
|   ]                 |        [                              | ]        | ]
|   / A               |        [                              | / A      | ]
@end example
Algorithm (modified version of the IMSL documentation)

This routine uses a scheme whereby DCADRE is computed as the sum of
estimates for the integral of F(x) over suitably chosen subintervals of
the given interval of integration. Starting with the interval of
integration itself as the first such subinterval, cautious Romberg
extrapolation is used to find an acceptable estimate on a given
subinterval. If this attempt fails, the subinterval is divided into two
subintervals of equal length, each of which is considered separately.
Programming Notes (modified version of the IMSL documentation)

@itemize @bullet
@item
1. DCADRE (the translated-Fortran base for IMSL_ROMBERG) can, in many cases,
   handle jump discontinuities and certain algebraic discontinuities. See 
   reference for full details.
@item
2. The relative error parameter ROMBERG_RERR must be in the interval [0.0,0.1].
   For example, ROMBERG_RERR=0.1 indicates that the estimate of the intergral 
   is to be correct to one digit, where as ROMBERG_RERR=1.0E-4 calls for four
   digits of accuracy. If DCADRE determines that the relative accuracy
   requirement cannot be satisfied, IER is set to 133 (ROMBERG_RERR should be
   large enough that, when added to 100.0, the result is a number greater than
   100.0 (this will not be true of very tiny floating point numbers due to
   the nature of machine arithmetic)).
@item
3. The absolute error parameter, ROMBERG_AERR, should be nonnegative. In
   order to give a reasonable value for ROMBERG_AERR, the user must know 
   the approximate magnitude of the integral being computed. In many cases,
   it is satisfactory to use AERR=0.0. In this case, only the relative error
   requirement is satisfied in the compuatation.
@item
4. We quote from the reference, ``A very cautious man would accept DCADRE 
   only if IER [the warning or error code] is 0 or 65. The merely reasonable
   man would keep the faith even if IER is 66. The adventurous man is quite 
   often right in accepting DCADRE even if the IER is 131 or 132.'' Even when
   IER is not 0, DCADRE returns the best estimate that has been computed.

@node FOURIER, NDIFFQ, DCADRE, Numerical
@section FOURIER
 - There is a Fast Fourier Transform package, do DESCRIBE(FFT)
for details.  There is also a Fourier Series package.  It may be
loaded with LOAD(FOURIE).  It will also calculate Fourier integral
coefficients and has various other functions to do such things as
replace all occurrences of F(ARG) by ARG in expression (like changing
ABS(a*x+b) to a*x+b).  Do PRINTFILE(FOURIE,USAGE,DSK,SHARE1); for
a list of the functions included.

@node NDIFFQ, Definitions for Numerical, FOURIER, Numerical
@section NDIFFQ
a package residing on the SHARE directory for numerical
solutions of differential equations.  LOAD("NDIFFQ"); will load it
in for use.  An example of its use would be:

@example
Define_Variable(N,0.3,FLOAT);
Define_Variable(H,0.175,FLOAT);
F(X,E):=(Mode_Declare([X,E],FLOAT),N*EXP(X)/(E+X^(2*H)*EXP(H*X)));
Compile(F);
Array([X,E],FLOAT,35);
Init_Float_Array(X,1.0E-3,6.85); /* Fills X with the interval */
E[0]:5.0;                        /* Initial condition */
Runge_Kutta(F,X,E);              /* Solve it */
Graph2(X,E);                     /* Graph the solution */
@end example
p.s. Runge_Kutta(F,X,E,E_Prime) would be the call for a second-order 
equation.

@c NOTE: Let's keep POLARTORECT, RECTTOPOLAR, and IFT before FFT
@c in this file. Otherwise DESCRIBE returns the FFT text (because
@c POLARTORECT, etc are list in the heading of FFT with @defunx).

@c @node POLARTORECT
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun POLARTORECT (magnitude_array, phase_array)

Translates complex values of the form r %e^(%i t) to the form a + b %i.
LOAD ("FFT")$ will load this function into Maxima. See also FFT.

The magnitude and phase, r and t, are taken from magnitude_array and
phase_array, respectively. The original values of the input arrays are
replaced by the real and imaginary parts, a and b, on return. The outputs are
equal to

@example
  a: r COS (t)
  b: r SIN (t)
@end example

The input arrays must be the same size and 1-dimensional.
The array size need not be a power of 2.

POLARTORECT is the inverse function of RECTTOPOLAR.

@end defun
@c @node RECTTOPOLAR
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun RECTTOPOLAR (real_array, imaginary_array)

Translates complex values of the form a + b %i to the form r %e^(%i t).
LOAD ("FFT")$ will load this function into Maxima. See also FFT.

The real and imaginary parts, a and b, are taken from real_array and
imaginary_array, respectively. The original values of the input arrays
are replaced by the magnitude and angle, r and t, on return. The outputs are
equal to

@example
  r: SQRT (a^2 + b^2)
  t: ATAN2 (b, a)
@end example

The computed angle is in the range -%pi to %pi. 

The input arrays must be the same size and 1-dimensional.
The array size need not be a power of 2.

RECTTOPOLAR is the inverse function of POLARTORECT.

@end defun
@c @node IFT
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun IFT (real_array, imaginary_array)

Fast inverse discrete Fourier transform. LOAD ("FFT")$ will load this function
into Maxima.

IFT carries out the inverse complex fast Fourier transform on
1-dimensional floating point arrays. The inverse transform is defined as

@example
  X[j]: SUM (Y[j] EXP (+2 %i %pi j k / n), k, 0, n-1)
@end example

See FFT for more details.

@end defun
@c @node FFT
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun FFT (real_array, imaginary_array)
@defunx IFT (real_array, imaginary_array)
@defunx RECTTOPOLAR (real_array, imaginary_array)
@defunx POLARTORECT (magnitude_array, phase_array)

Fast Fourier transform and related functions. LOAD ("FFT")$ will
load these functions into Maxima.

FFT and IFT carry out the complex fast Fourier transform and
inverse transform, respectively, on 1-dimensional floating
point arrays. The size of imaginary_array must equal the size of real_array.

FFT and IFT operate in-place. That is, on return from FFT or IFT,
the original content of the input arrays is replaced by the output.
The FILLARRAY function can make a copy of an array, should it
be necessary.

The discrete Fourier transform and inverse transform are defined
as follows. Let X be the original data, with

@example
  X[i]: real_array[i] + %i imaginary_array[i]
@end example
  
Let Y be the transformed data. The forward and inverse transforms are

@example
  Y[k]: (1/n) SUM (X[j] EXP (-2 %i %pi j k / n), j, 0, n-1)

  X[j]:       SUM (Y[j] EXP (+2 %i %pi j k / n), k, 0, n-1)
@end example

Suitable arrays can be allocated by the ARRAY function. For example:

@example
  ARRAY (my_array, FLOAT, n-1)$
@end example

declares a 1-dimensional array with n elements, indexed from 0 through
n-1 inclusive. The number of elements n must be equal to 2^m for some m.

FFT can be applied to real data (imaginary array all zeros) to obtain
sine and cosine coefficients. After calling FFT, the sine and cosine
coefficients, say A and B, can be calculated as

@example
  A[0]: real_array[0]
  B[0]: 0
@end example

and

@example
  A[j]: real_array[j] + real_array[n-j]
  B[j]: imaginary_array[j] - imaginary_array[n-j]
@end example

for j equal to 1 through n/2-1, and

@example
  A[n/2]: real_array[n/2]
  B[n/2]: 0
@end example

RECTTOPOLAR translates complex values of the form a + b %i to
the form r %e^(%i t). See RECTTOPOLAR.

POLARTORECT translates complex values of the form r %e^(%i t)
to the form a + b %i. See POLARTORECT.

e.g. FORTRAN(X); where X:A*B$ has been done, then X=@{value of X@}, e.g.
X=A*B will be generated.  In particular, if e.g. M:MATRIX(...); has
been done, then FORTRAN(M); will generate the appropriate assignment
statements of the form name(i,j)=<corresponding matrix element>.
FORTINDENT[0] controls the left margin of expressions printed out, 0

@c @node INTERPOLATE
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun INTERPOLATE (func,x,a,b)
finds the zero of func as x varies.  The last
two args give the range to look in.  The function must have a
different sign at each endpoint.  If this condition is not met, the
action of the of the function is governed by INTPOLERROR[TRUE]).  If
INTPOLERROR is TRUE then an error occurs, otherwise the value of
INTPOLERROR is returned (thus for plotting INTPOLERROR might be set to
0.0).  Otherwise (given that MACSYMA can evaluate the first argument
in the specified range, and that it is continuous) INTERPOLATE is
guaranteed to come up with the zero (or one of them if there is more
than one zero).  The accuracy of INTERPOLATE is governed by
INTPOLABS[0.0] and INTPOLREL[0.0] which must be non-negative floating
point numbers.  INTERPOLATE will stop when the first arg evaluates to
something less than or equal to INTPOLABS or if successive
approximants to the root differ by no more than INTPOLREL * <one of
the approximants>.  The default values of INTPOLABS and INTPOLREL are
0.0 so INTERPOLATE gets as good an answer as is possible with the
single precision arithmetic we have.  The first arg may be an
equation.  The order of the last two args is irrelevant.  Thus

@example
INTERPOLATE(SIN(X)=X/2,X,%PI,.1);
   is equivalent to
INTERPOLATE(SIN(X)=X/2,X,.1,%PI);
@end example
The method used is a binary search in the range specified by the last
two args.  When it thinks the function is close enough to being
linear, it starts using linear interpolation.
An alternative syntax has been added to interpolate, this replaces the
first two arguments by a function name.  The function MUST be
TRANSLATEd or compiled function of one argument.  No checking of the
result is done, so make sure the function returns a floating point
number.


@example
F(X):=(MODE_DECLARE(X,FLOAT),SIN(X)-X/2.0);
INTERPOLATE(SIN(X)-X/2,X,0.1,%PI)       time= 60 msec
INTERPOLATE(F(X),X,0.1,%PI);            time= 68 msec
TRANSLATE(F);
INTERPOLATE(F(X),X,0.1,%PI);            time= 26 msec
INTERPOLATE(F,0.1,%PI);                 time=  5 msec

function at the endpoints of the interpolation interval are opposite
in sign.  If they are of opposite sign, the interpolation proceeds.
If they are of like sign, and INTPOLERROR is TRUE, then an error is
signaled.  If they are of like sign and INTPOLERROR is not TRUE, the
value of INTPOLERROR is returned.  Thus for plotting, INTPOLERROR

that everything evaluate to a flonum. Thus
NEWTON(x^2-a^2,x,a/2,a^2/100);
will say that it can't tell if flonum*a^2<a^2/100. Doing ASSUME(a>0);
and then doing NEWTON again works. You get x=a+<small flonum>*a which
is symbolic all the way.  INTERPOLATE(x^2-a^2,x,a/2,2*a); complains
that .5*a is not flonum...
