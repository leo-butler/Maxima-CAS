	* descriptive.texi:
	  I have rewritten the statistical graphics functions of package
	  descriptive.	They now depend on package draw and can use all the
	  options defined in this package.

	  These are the current statistical graphics functions:  -
	  scatterplot (new)  - histogram (rewritten)  - barsplot
	  (rewritten)  - piechart (new)  - boxplot (rewritten)

	  descriptive package automatically loads draw if it wasn't loaded
	  before.

	  Old graphics functions are still in package descriptive, but
	  removed from documentation:  - dataplot: it was written when
	  plot2d and plot3d couldn't	   plot sample points. This is no
	  longer so, and we also       have package draw at this moment.
	  Use new function	 scatterplot for multivariate (and
	  univariate) scatter	    plots.   - old histogram, barsplot and
	  boxplot have been renamed to	      histogram2, barsplot2 and
	  boxplot2, respectively, so	    that you can use your old code
	  with only some minor	      changes. But sooner or later they
	  will be removed	 from descriptive.

	  of speech verbiage for matchfix

2007-09-09 18:00  robert_dodier

	* Trigonometric.texi: Put in missing period.

2007-09-09 17:50  robert_dodier

	* maxima.texi, stringproc.texi: In stringproc package, cut out
	  parsetoken and move parse_string and eval_string into its place;
	  parsetoken implemented its own parser while parse_string and
	  eval_string use Maxima's parser, and it seems inadvisable to have
	  a different parser. I asked Volker van Nek about it and these
	  changes are OK by him.

	   * src/max_ext.lisp:
	      remove $parsetoken from list of autoload functions
	   * share/contrib/stringproc/stringproc.lisp:
	      cut out $parsetoken
	   * share/contrib/stringproc/rteststringproc.mac:
	      replace tests of parsetoken with tests of parse_string and
	  eval_string
	   * doc/info/Makefile.am:
	      remove eval_string.texi from list of files (now merged into
	  stringproc)
	   * doc/info/eval_string.texi:
	      remove file (text merged into stringproc.texi)
	   * doc/info/maxima.texi:
	      cut out @node eval_string
	   * doc/info/stringproc.texi:
	      replace parsetoken with parse_string and eval_string

2007-09-07 19:59  rtoy

	* Program.texi: Document mapprint and make it a defmvar.

2007-09-04 21:03  andrejv

	* implicit_plot.texi: Don't say that implicit_plot works only with
	  gnuplot (it also works for the openmath plot format).

2007-09-03 00:43  dgildea

	* Polynomials.texi: default gcd is spmod.  subres is no longer
	  "new".

2007-09-02 05:06  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Mention tex(foo, false) => Lisp string in the
	  description of tex.

2007-08-23 14:34  riotorto

	* draw.texi:
	  * New graphics options: 'xaxis, 'yaxis, 'zaxis,   'xaxis_width,
	  'yaxis_width, 'zaxis_width,	'xaxis_type, 'yaxis_type,
	  'zaxis_type,	 'xaxis_color, 'yaxis_color, 'zaxis_color.  *
	  geomap also works in 3d, with three available   projections:
	  spherical, cylindrical and conic.  * new terminals added: 'gif,
	  'animated_gif (external programs   are no longer necessary) and
	  'wxt (wxwidgets).    (Note: terminals wxt, jpg and animated_gif
	  don't    work in windows, since wgnuplot was not    compiled for
	  them.)  * Option 'delay added for animated gif's * Continents
	  coastlines added in worldmap.mac * Graphics object 'points
	  accepts one-column, two-column,   one-row and two-row matrices in
	  2d, and three-column and   three-row matrices in 3d.

2007-07-30 05:31  robert_dodier

	* lsquares.texi: Change convention for residuals to lhs minus rhs
	  (was rhs minus lhs).	New convention is consistent with
	  definition of error as y = foo(x) + error which is typical in
	  statistics texts. Code, tests, and documentation all changed.

2007-07-30 03:57  robert_dodier

	* lsquares.texi: Replace previous lsquares (least squares) package.
	   Features of new version:

	  (1) Formulate numerical problem as a minimization (solved via
	  lbfgs) instead of a system of equations (solved via mnewton).
	  The minimization formulation is more likely to converge (since
	  there is always a notion of the correct direction, namely
	  downhill) (2) Separate functions for exact vs numerical estimates
	  (3) Separate functions to construct the mean square error
	  expression, residuals, and residual mean square error.  Residual
	  MSE function supersedes the DETCOEF global variable (4) Test
	  script with many examples. Includes examples from previous
	  implementation and others (5) Revised documentation

	  Files:

	   * share/contrib/lsquares.mac: replaced implementation
	   * share/contrib/rtest_lsquares.mac: test script
	   * doc/info/lsquares.texi: revised documentation

	  Implementation note: Values obtained for numerical estimates vary
	  from one Lisp implementation to another. That's disconcerting but
	  I don't know how to make them all agree. The test script fudges
	  this point by testing some examples with a greater tolerance.

2007-07-26 15:21  riotorto

	* draw.texi: Style changes and Spanish translation

2007-07-24 22:46  riotorto

	* draw.texi, maxima.texi:
	  * Now, draw always writes two files: maxout.gnuplot (gnuplot
	  preamble and command) and data.gnuplot (numeric data). In   non
	  windows systems, Maxima calls gnuplot via pipes, but	 the only
	  command is now 'load maxima.gnuplot'. I reached   the limits of
	  piping with the new geomap object and this   trick fixes the
	  problem. This change also lets zooming   in windows (I think).

	  * I have reorganized the documentatiion on draw. You can ask
	  for information on both graphic options and objects:	 ?
	  point_type, ? image, ? geomap, etc.

	  * 2D points: if you give object 'points a list of numbers,
	  abscissas are automatically set to consecutive positive
	  integers: points([2,6,2,9]) plots [1,2],[2,6],   [3,2] and [4,9].

	  * 2D & 3D label: each string, together with its coordinates,
	  must be enclosed between brackets. Now you can write as many
	  labels as you want calling 'label only once, as in
	  label([hi,0,0],[you,1,1]). label(hi,0,0) returns an	error, but
	  label([hi,0,0]) is correct.

	  * Package 'picture added. This gives basic support for   image
	  processing and reads picture files in xpm format.    This package
	  is (very) unstable and not well suited for	rendering large
	  photos. You can build a picture object from a    matrix or from
	  an xpm file and pass it to 'image, as in
	  draw2d(image(read_xpm(myfile.xpm),0,0,10,10)).    Package
	  'picture is automatically loaded with 'draw.	  See examples in
	   http://www.telefonica.net/web2/biomates/maxima/gpdraw/image

	  * New 2D graphic object geomap for drawing maps. Examples in
	  http://www.telefonica.net/web2/biomates/maxima/gpdraw/geomap
	  Notes on geomap:   - Some boundaries and islands are
	  controversial. I tried to	define countries according to the
	  borders recognized by     the United Nations. Please, don't feel
	  offended due to     my mistakes and/or ignorance.    - The WBD
	  doesn't contain borders for Eritrea.	  - I have assigned the
	  antarctic islands to the Antarctica	   variable.	- The WBD
	  doesn't separate european and asian Russia,	   that's why I
	  haven't included Russia as an european      country.	  - The WDB
	  contains some lakes not yet included here.	- When drawing
	  countries as coloured polygons, don't forget	    that some
	  countries are completely surrounded by other	    countries:
	  San_Marino by Italy and Lesotho by South_Africa.    - File
	  share/wdb.lisp contains boundary coordinates as lisp	    arrays,
	  and in share/worldmap.map are the country and      continent
	  definitions.

	  * All the above changes are included in doc/info/draw.texi,	but
	  the Spanish documentation will be commited before   the next
	  release of Maxima, together with some minor changes.

2007-07-23 03:07  robert_dodier

	* Expressions.texi, Input.texi, Rules.texi: Change all examples
	  which make use of "@" as an operator to something else (e.g. "@@"
	  or "##"). The operator "@" is used by the defstruct code which is
	  now built-in, so "@" in examples conflicted with that.  Examples

	  changed.

2007-04-02 00:57  robert_dodier

	* Operators.texi, Program.texi: Make Maxima comfortable with
	  partially-evaluated Boolean expressions by merging code from
	  share/contrib/boolsimp.lisp into src.  (Only the stuff for
	  Boolean expressions has been brought over; the stuff for
	  partially-evaluated conditional expressions was not.)

	  The global flag prederror is still honored. When prederror=true,
	  Boolean expressions which evaluate (under "is", "if", or one of
	  the operators "and", "or", or "not") to something other than true
	  or false trigger an error.  The default value of prederror is now
	  false (was true).

	  With these modifications, run_testsuite() (including new tests
	  for Boolean expressions) succeeds without unexpected errors.

	  Residual strangeness: "and", "or", and "not" cause evaluation of
	  their operands via MEVALP. So (foo or bar) is equivalent to
	  (?mevalp(foo) or ?mevalp(bar)). This is mostly OK but for
	  operands which are a=b or a#b, MEVALP always returns T or NIL so
	  "and", "or", and "not" turn anything with = or # into true or
	  false. I'm inclined to think that's a bug. (The structure of the
	  previous code was pretty much entirely preserved, which is the
	  source of this bug; there may be other strangeness present for
	  the same reason.)

	    * doc/info/Operators.texi:
	      Update descriptions of "and", "or", and "not"
	      Update descriptions of "equal" and "notequal"

	    * doc/info/Program.texi:

	      Define simplification functions for Boolean operators

	      Redefine MAND, MOR, and MNOT

	    * src/trpred.lisp:

	    * tests/Makefile.am:
	      Put rtest_boolean.mac on list of files
	      Put rtest_mset.mac on list (was omitted by mistake before)

	    * tests/rtest_boolean.mac: (new)
	      Tests for partially-evaluated Boolean expressions

	    * tests/rtestsum.mac:
	      Problem 5 no longer fails so cut out comment about known

	    * tests/testsuite.lisp;

	      Put rtest_boolean on list of tests

	  non-atom for a subscripted function expression, and make a few
	  more examples.

2007-03-08 03:54  robert_dodier

	* Help.texi, Input.texi, maxima.texi: Revise documentation for
	  describe and for ? shortcut to say that exact search is the
	  default. I have revised all of the existing documentation files
	  and I believe I have done OK (in part because the relevant text
	  is not translated in all languages yet), except for German, which
	  definitely needs to be reviewed.  Other languages can also
	  benefit from review.

	  In addition, I have cut out the @node "Introduction to Help" from
	  all languages, because it was only a duplicate of text which also
	  appears in "describe".

	  With these changes, make succeeds for es and es-utf8, but not any
	  variety of pt.  I believe the make problems with pt are due to
	  some other problem.  Other languages are not in the make system
	  yet.

	* dynamics.texi: Added documentation and figures for the two new
	  functions: mandelbrot and julia

2006-11-29 05:35  robert_dodier

	* Help.texi, Input.texi: Merge revision of describe into CVS main
	  branch.  Merge was accomplished by cvs update -j
	  describe-revision-base -j describe-revision-branch followed by
	  manual adjustment of doc/info/Makefile.am and
	  doc/info/*/Makefile.am (only minor adjustments were needed for
	  each Makefile.am).  With result of merge, make, make check, make
	  install all succeed, and describe functions work as expected for
	  en, es_ES, es_ES.UTF-8, pt_BR, and pt_BR.UTF-8.

	  The one remaining wart is that a warning message is printed the
	  first time some documentation is accessed. This is from the
	  autoload mechanism.  We should figure out a way to quiet the
	  message (by avoiding autoload or otherwise).

2006-11-28 06:35  robert_dodier

	* Help.texi, Input.texi: Add description of ?! and describe(foo,
	  exact).

	* Constants.texi: New item %i (imaginary unit). Apparently
	  undocumented before.

2006-11-05 17:45  robert_dodier

	* Bugs.texi: Cut out uninformative section "Introduction to Bug
	  Detection and Reporting".

2006-11-05 03:07  robert_dodier

	* Constants.texi, Operators.texi: Enclose @fnindex and @vrindex in
	  @ifinfo / @end ifinfo, because texi2html complains about @fnindex
	  and @vrindex.  Too bad about that, really; the extra index items
	  would be very helpful.

2006-11-04 21:07  ficmatinfmag

	* Command.texi, Input.texi, Itensor.texi, Matrices.texi,
	  Number.texi, orthopoly.texi: Enclosing vrindex and fnindex with
	  ifinfo-endifinfo to keep alert messages during doc compilation
	  clean. orthoply.texi -> minor bugs

	* maxima.texi: Put Comments:: (new section in Input.texi) in list
	  of topics.

2006-07-26 05:10  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Added a node to describe the comment /* */ syntax.

2006-07-26 03:20  robert_dodier

	* Equations.texi, linearalgebra.texi, nset.texi, Plotting.texi: Cut
	  trailing spaces off some example lines, as detected by grep '^@c
	  .* $' *i .  I believe that no example line has a trailing space
	  now.	I did not re-execute update_examples because many of the
	  example blocks in the affected files do not have the @c ===beg===
	  / @c ===end=== markers.

2006-07-26 02:54  robert_dodier

	* Operators.texi: Execute update_examples again to fix a few
	  examples.  In particular, the example which has the unitfrac
	  function in it is OK now.  There was a trailing space on the line
	  "reverse(uf));" and that was confusing to the Maxima input
	  parser, and no %i2 was output, so update_examples got confused
	  too.

2006-07-25 12:57  ficmatinfmag

	* ggf.texi: changing Default variable to Default value (again)

2006-07-25 11:50  ficmatinfmag

	  yet been updated.

2006-07-24 06:13  robert_dodier

	* Operators.texi: Attempted to clarify = # equal notequal. Expanded
	  texts and made up new examples. Examples are in the @c comments
	  but outputs are not yet generated (next revision).

2006-07-23 22:14  riotorto

	  into an example for openmath.  Improved one of the figures and
	  included the figures in the Spanish version.	and

2006-07-04 19:07  robert_dodier

	* nset.texi: Cut out bit about primep(1) = true. That bug has been
	  fixed.

2006-07-03 22:01  robert_dodier

	* Logarithms.texi: Make it clear that logarc is both a function and
	  a variable.

2006-07-03 21:40  robert_dodier

	* nset.texi: Heavy revisions. Probably most items in this file have
	  been touched.   - Revise kron_delta and <foo>reduce functions for
	  greater clarity   - Organize text to put exposition before
	  examples   - Additional examples, and examples for functions
	  which had none before   - List identities when known (stirling1,
	  stirling2)   - Attempts at greater clarity and stylistic changes
	  throughout   - Minor corrections and updates throughout

2006-07-03 21:27  van_nek

	* simplifications.texi: cut out documentation of 'quadratic'

2006-07-02 05:54  robert_dodier

	* descriptive.texi, Floating.texi: Make display, grind, and tex of
	  ordinary floats respect fpprintprec.

	  Before, EXPLODEN (called by display code and grind) respected
	  fpprec, which isn't right because fpprec is a computational
	  precision for bigfloats.  fpprintprec is the printing precision
	  for bigfloats, so use that for ordinary floats as well. TeX code
	  didn't call EXPLODEN so it didn't respect fpprec (nor
	  fpprintprec).

	  This committed version has a couple of warts, both in EXPLODEN.
	  (1) EXPLODEN tries to print numbers in a nice way.	  The way
	  it is now coded, the number of digits is often      not exactly
	  equal to the specified printing precision.  (2) EXPLODEN contains
	  a literal constant 16. That is OK for     64 bit floats but if
	  ever there were 80 bit floats,     some digits would be
	  needlessly suppressed.

	   - src/commac.lisp:
	     in EXPLODEN, work with fpprintprec instead of fpprec

	   - src/mactex.lisp:
	     in TEXNUMFORMAT, call EXPLODEN instead of EXPLODE
	     fix bug in MYPRINC which caused tex commands to be broken over
	  end of line

	   - doc/info/Floating.texi:
	     rewrite description of fpprintprec

	   - doc/info/descriptive.texi:
	     work with fpprintprec instead of fpprec

	  Here is a test script. Output seems to be OK, accepting item (1)
	  above as it stands.

2006-01-09 00:01  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi, Equations.texi, Function.texi, Rules.texi:
	  Regularizing use of intermediate expression (%t) labels.  I
	  (Robert Dodier) have attempted to implement these policies:

	   - All functions which generate intermediate expression labels
	  ignore nolabels.
	     (Previously some functions observed nolabels and some did
	  not.)

	   - All functions which generate intermediate expression labels
	     return the labels, either as a list of labels or in an
	  expression.
	     (Previous some such functions returned "done".)

	  I believe that these are now followed by all functions which
	  generate intermediate expression labels, although it is possible
	  I overlooked something.

	  Changes:

	   src/comm.lisp:
	     in ELABEL, ignore nolabels (always bind label to expression,
	     and tell MAKELABEL to put label on the labels infolist)
	   src/csimp2.lisp:
	     ignore nolabels in XRUTOUT (called from solve and linsolve)
	   src/matrun.lisp:
	     in $DISPRULE, return list of labels (previously returned
	  "done")
	   src/mlisp.lisp:
	     in $DISPFUN, return list of labels (previously returned
	  "done")
	   doc/info/Command.texi:
	     updated description of nolabels
	   doc/info/Equations.texi:
	     updated description of globalsolve, linsolve, and solve
	     added examples to linsolve
	   doc/info/Function.texi:
	     updated description of dispfun
	   doc/info/Rules.texi:
	     updated description of disprule, added examples

	  With these changes, make, make install, and run_testsuite
	  succeed.  Also, when tests/rtestlabels.mac is executed by
	  copy/paste at the input prompt (some labels functionality cannot
	  be tested through the testsuite code because the testsuite system
	  disables labels), the output is as expected.

2006-01-07 20:22  robert_dodier

	* nset.texi: Fixed a couple of squiggly braces (need to put @

	  appropriate.	This file still needs work, especially the items
	  related to Poisson series.  It would be very helpful to indicate

	  section should be revised to split off specint into its own
	  @defun, and expand the summary to more than just a list of
	  functions.

	  from Maxima session into @example blocks. I edited some outputs
	  -- there is debug output which prints integers n, n-1, n-2, ...,
	  1 on successive lines; I cut out that output.  Debug outputs
	  should probably be disabled in the source code.  This file should
	  be translated from French to English.

	  Still needs work.

2005-02-27 19:03  robert_dodier

	* Series.texi: Formatting fixups, attempt to clarify some items.
	  Also changed pade example so that it succeeds (X and x were mixed
	  before, now all x).

2005-02-27 16:43  robert_dodier

	* Differentiation.texi, Series.texi: Change uppercase to lowercase,

	* Polynomials.texi: Reworked a number of items: rewording,
	  enclosing names in @code or @var as appropriate, additional
	  examples in some cases.  This file still needs work.

	  changes of wording in some items.  Still more work to do here.

2005-01-05 05:44  robert_dodier

	* maxima.texi: Fixing @nodes: FOURIER -> Fourier; strike out ndiffq
	  (obsolete, nonexistent).

2005-01-05 05:43  robert_dodier

	* Numerical.texi: Strike out @node for obsolete package ndiffq.
	  There doesn't appear to be an ndiffq.mac or ndiffq.mc file, and
	  the ndiffq.dem and ndiffq.usg files are already in
	  archive/share/unknown/. Lacking any code to execute, I'm cutting
	  ndiffq out of the documentation.

2005-01-05 05:31  robert_dodier

	* Numerical.texi: Adjust @node names (Fourier and ndiffq to
	  lowercase).  Strike out obsolete, commented-out @node and

	  bfhzeta, bfpsi, and burn.

2005-01-04 03:41  robert_dodier

	* Number.texi: Strike out obsolete, nonexistent function "prime"
	  and obsolete variable (still defined in code, never used)
	  "maxprime".  ("primep" is implemented and does work as expected.)

	  Revised other items, put examples into some of them.

2005-01-02 19:25  robert_dodier

2004-12-25 21:09  robert_dodier

	* Function.texi: Strike out description of obsolete, nonexistent
	  function "bindtest".	(As a flag, "bindtest" is recognized by
	  "declare" and described there.  "declare (a, bindtest)" works as
	  advertised -- MEVAL1 checks the "bindtest" flag.)

2004-12-23 03:19  vttoth

	  alignment.  Blank line before each @example and after each @end
	  example.

2004-12-04 08:43  robert_dodier

	* Expressions.texi: Typographical edits:  - lowercase for functions
	  and variables  - split some text blocks into paragraphs  - write
	  "Default value: xxx" instead of "default: [xxx]"  - Put "When
	  @code{foo} is @code{true}" or some such in front of
	  descriptions of variables  - "See also @code{foo}" instead of "Do

2004-12-03 23:28  vttoth

	* Atensor.texi, Itensor.texi, maxima.texi: Reorganized the tensor
	  documentation. Added documentation on Atensor.

2004-11-29 15:40  robert_dodier

	* Simplification.texi: Write names in lowercase and enclose with
	  @code{}.

	  Strike out description of obsolete, nonexistent functions "simp".

	  Some changes of content, e.g., demoivre and exponentialize.
	  However there is still more work to be done on the content.

2004-11-29 05:13  vttoth

	* Ctensor.texi:
	  More tensor documentation updates.

2004-11-28 18:47  robert_dodier

	* Simplification.texi: Reworded descriptions of variables to
	  separate statement of default value from description, and to put
	  name of variable into the description, e.g., "When @code{fooflag}
	  is TRUE, ..." or "@code{foo} is the ...".

	  Strike out obsolete item "radprodexpand" (no such variable, never

	  Some descriptions (assoc) and examples are fixed.

	  Problems to be fixed later:	- `flatten' doesn't work or even
	  exists in Maxima (remove?)   - move definition for `get' to other
	  section or add definition for `put'	  in this one (keep get/put
	  in one place)   - `reverse' plot option doesn't work (remove?)

2004-11-28 16:06  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: Put last few bits of text before the examples.

2004-11-28 05:56  robert_dodier

	  Suppress mention of obsolete options gctime and totaltime for the
	  playback function. These options are still processed by playback,
	  but have the same effect as the time option.

2004-11-28 03:15  vttoth

	* Ctensor.texi: [no log message]

2004-11-28 03:12  vttoth

	  Updating CTENSOR/ITENSOR documentation.

2004-11-28 00:17  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: A few minor wording changes in "integrate".

2004-11-27 23:46  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: Rework description of "integrate" somewhat:
	  discussion of noun form, additional examples, list all examples
	  by theme, minor wording changes.

	  Revise description of "changevar" somewhat.

2004-11-27 01:40  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: Clarify, update, and expand "integrate". Still
	  more work planned here.

	  Mention "ev (%, nouns)" in "changevar".

2004-11-26 18:36  robert_dodier

	* Floating.texi: Add comment header with inventory of functions in
	  bffac.mac and which ones are documented where.

	  Minor typographical changes.

	  "zunderflow".

2004-11-26 17:36  robert_dodier

	* Floating.texi: Change names to lowercase and enclose in @code{}
	  throughout.

	  Strike out obsolete @c @node comments.

	  Minor changes of wording and typography (in particular,
	  regularize upper/lower case).

2004-11-26 15:39  rtoy

	* maxima.texi: Fix typo in node.

2004-11-25 18:00  robert_dodier

	* Simplification.texi: Strike out description of obsolete function
	  apply_nouns.	There is no definition of apply_nouns in the source
	  code.

2004-11-25 07:20  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: Change names to lowercase and enclose in
	  @code{} as needed.

	  Rework many examples. All examples now have %i, %o labels, and
	  all of them work as advertised (at least on my desktop box).

	  Strike out obsolete function INTSCE and associated variable
	  ERRINTSCE.

	  Strike out obsolete @c @node comments.

	  Minor wording changes.

	  The description of "integrate" is not very clear, still needs
	  work.  The recent QUADPACK fcns supersede the previous "dblint",
	  "quanc8", and "romberg" fcns; I'm inclined to think those should
	  be cut out.

2004-11-25 02:25  vttoth

	* Ctensor.texi:
	  Bugs in tensor texi files prevented them from compiling cleanly.

2004-11-25 01:49  vttoth

	* Ctensor.texi:
	  First round of changes to bring all CTENSOR/ITENSOR documentation
	  up-to-date.

2004-11-24 06:36  robert_dodier

	* Floating.texi: Strike out description of obsolete function
	  "floatdefunk".  There isn't a definition for it anywhere in src
	  or share.

2004-11-24 05:50  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Substitute lowercase for uppercase names of
	  variables and functions.  Enclose variables and functions in
	  @code{} in text.

	  Strike out description of obsolete function "clearscreen".
	  Definition of clearscreen should also be struck out of source
	  code (untouched at present).

2004-11-23 17:01  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Change uppercase to lowercase throughout.  Enclose
	  expressions and names of things in @code{}.  Reworked description
	  of "playback". Additional rewordings for clarity.

2004-11-22 00:13  robert_dodier

	* Differentiation.texi, Equations.texi, Expressions.texi,
	  Floating.texi, Function.texi, Help.texi, Input.texi,
	  Integration.texi, Lists.texi, Rules.texi, Series.texi,
	  Special.texi, Trigonometric.texi: Substitute spaces for tab
	  characters in @example blocks to yield uniform appearance. Also
	  take the opportunity to make other alignment adjustments and to
	  change uppercase to lowercase in affected @example blocks.

	  Most @examples affected were regenerated in a Maxima session and
	  then copied. Some bugs were found in attempts to regenerate
	  examples; comments like "@c !!!" were left at appropriate places.

	  The linel (display width) variable was set to 69 instead of the
	  default 79 so that indented @example blocks don't fall off the
	  end of an 80 char display. ("describe" seems to indent @examples
	  by 10 spaces.)

	  Only a fraction of the @example blocks are affected by these
	  changes.  There is a lot of work remaining to fix up @examples.

2004-11-21 23:34  robert_dodier

	* Program.texi: Remove reference to obsolete control character
	  ctrl-^.

2004-11-21 19:37  vvzhy

	  description.

	  Removed stuff about control characters other than control-C from
	  descriptions of "quit" and "to_lisp".

2004-11-19 16:15  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Change all Maxima function and variable names to
	  lowercase, both in the headings (@defun, @defvar) and in the
	  text.  Quote occurences of function and variable names with @code
	  in the text.	I've inspected the diff to the previous revision,
	  and also printed each description within Maxima (using "?
	  topic"), and I'm pretty sure I haven't introduced typos or other
	  simple-minded errors.

2004-11-18 06:06  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Updated and clarified descriptions of "evflag" and
	  "evfun".

2004-11-17 18:50  vvzhy

	* Command.texi: Reworked description of "ev": split discussion of
	  flags into @itemize items; reworded the intro paragraph; convert
	  Maxima names to lowercase; put @code around quoted names; fixed
	  some minor typos. Content mostly unchanged.

2004-11-17 07:08  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Change @itemize to @enumerate in description of
	  "ev".  Change code in @examples in "ev" to lowercase.  Added a
	  blurb about "programmode" in description of "labels".

2004-11-16 21:53  robert_dodier

	* Affine.texi, Arrays.texi, Command.texi, Constants.texi,
	  Floating.texi, Function.texi, Help.texi, Input.texi,
	  Integration.texi, Lists.texi, maxima.texi, Miscellaneous.texi:
	  Changed LISP and lisp to Lisp as need be. Instances of LISP and
	  lisp which refer to filename extensions were let stand.

2004-11-16 21:30  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Reworked descriptions of `kill' and `labels' for

	  the Bessel functions.

2004-11-09 05:55  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Strike out @defun %TH which is redundant with
	  identically named item in Input.texi. Strike out description of
	  obsolete function RESTORE (broken, but still in dskfn.lisp).

2004-11-09 05:55  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Strike out discussion of obsolete systems and
	  commands from introductory section. Strike out @section PLAYBACK
	  which described an obsolete key binding. (There exists a
	  description of non-obsolete function PLAYBACK elsewhere.)

	  Update and expand somewhat the descriptions of % and %%. Update
	  description of %TH.

	  Revise and expand description of SAVE. Minor changes to LOAD.

2004-11-09 05:54  robert_dodier

	* maxima.texi: Strike out PLAYBACK from list of topics for Input
	  and Output (section struck out of Input.texi).

2004-11-06 05:49  robert_dodier

	  Polynomials.texi: Substitute "Maxima" for "maxima" when "this
	  computer program" is intended.

2004-11-05 03:37  robert_dodier

	* Function.texi: Strike out the content-free @defmac BUILDQ --
	  there exists a @defun BUILDQ which has substantial content, and
	  the @defmac was apparently confusing to cl-info.lisp.

	  term is understood to mean "this program". Some instances of
	  Macsyma, etc., were just struck out. There remain some instances
	  of Macsyma where it means "the predecessor of Maxima" or in
	  quoted texts. Although the presence of "Macsyma" generally
	  indicates out-of-date documentation, e.g. references to obsolete
	  hardware and software, no further attempt was made in this
	  revision to make updates.

	* Command.texi, Input.texi, Integration.texi, maxima.texi,
	  Numerical.texi, Special.texi, Trigonometric.texi: Expunge mention
	  of FASSAVE and FASL files from .texi documents.  FASSAVE
	  description removed from Input.texi. Mentions of FASL removed
	  from Input.texi and other documents. See also bug report #782386.

2004-11-03 05:14  robert_dodier

	* Function.texi: Moved obsolete @section OPTIMIZATION to None.texi.
	  Struck out a mention of the FASL file type.

2004-11-02 05:45  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Updated and clarified descriptions of LOAD and
	  LOADFILE. Moved some stuff from LOAD into FILE_SEARCH.

2004-10-31 20:05  robert_dodier

	* Trigonometric.texi: Under TRIGREDUCE, strike out reference to
	  section number "6.6".

2004-10-31 20:04  robert_dodier

	* Operators.texi: Under SUBLIS, strike out reference to
	  "SHARE2;SUBLIS INFO" (out of date, and can't find an up to date
	  replacement).

2004-10-31 20:03  robert_dodier

	* Miscellaneous.texi: Under REMOVE, strike out reference to
	  "Appendix II".

2004-10-31 20:02  robert_dodier

	* Integration.texi: Under ROMBERG, strike out DESCRIBE with two
	  arguments (can't actually do that); unneeded, so no replacement.

2004-10-31 20:01  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Under LOAD, bring stmt about init file up to date;
	  also put in missing @example/@end example tags.

2004-10-31 20:00  robert_dodier

	* Help.texi: Bring stmt about default value up to date.

2004-10-31 19:59  robert_dodier

	* Floating.texi: Fix typos in names; also bring file path up to
	  date.

2004-10-31 19:58  robert_dodier

	* Expressions.texi: s/INTEGRAL/integral/ (no such symbol INTEGRAL,
	  none intended).

2004-10-31 19:57  robert_dodier

	* Equations.texi: Strike out stmt about KILL(LABELS) -- commented
	  out in .mac file, so it doesn't happen.

2004-10-31 19:56  robert_dodier

	* Ctensor.texi: Fixed a couple of names that were out of date.

2004-10-31 18:46  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Description of LOAD now refers to FILE_SEARCH as a
	  function, and FILE_SEARCH_MAXIMA and FILE_SEARCH_LISP as
	  variables. LOAD still needs a lot of work.

2004-10-31 17:53  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Cut out descriptions of obsolete functions BACKUP,
	  BATCON, NOSTRING, and SPRINT, and obsolete variables BATCHKILL,
	  BATCOUNT, CHANGE_FILEDEFAULTS, DIREC, DSKALL, FILENAME, FILENUM,
	  FILE_STRING_PRINT, LINEDISP, and PARSEWINDOW. Source code
	  untouched. Also put in some comments, marked by !!! and ???, for
	  future content changes.

2004-10-31 01:36  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Update and clarify descriptions of WRITEFILE,
	  APPENDFILE, and CLOSEFILE.

2004-10-30 23:25  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Update, expand, and clarify description of
	  FILE_SEARCH function and the related variables
	  FILE_SEARCH_MAXIMA, FILE_SEARCH_LISP, and FILE_SEARCH_DEMO.
	  Description of variables split off from function description --
	  all three variables are described by the same block of text.

2004-10-30 06:15  robert_dodier

	* Debugging.texi: Attempted to clarify the documentation about
	  Maxima source code debugging.  Moved Emacs-specific stuff into a
	  subsection below non-Emacs description.

2004-10-30 04:15  robert_dodier

	* Bugs.texi: Expansion of description of BUG_REPORT. Slight
	  rewording of description of BUILD_INFO (specifically say that
	  BUILD_INFO prints out its output, to distinguish it from a return
	  value).

2004-10-29 16:14  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Updated and clarified description of the
	  maxima-init.mac file.  This description is the sole item under
	  the heading "Introduction for Runtime Environment" at present;
	  heading should probably be changed to better reflect the content.

2004-10-29 15:22  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Update and clarify items INTERRUPTS and
	  CLEARSCREEN.	The CLEARSCREEN function is obsolete (does not but
	  complain "cant clear window") so the description should probably
	  be cut out entirely, and the function as well. At present the
	  description documents the observed behavior.

2004-10-28 06:45  robert_dodier

	* Debugging.texi: Update and clarify descriptions of REFCHECK,
	  SETCHECK, SETCHECKBREAK, and SETVAL.

	  Strike out description of obsolete, nonexistent function
	  REMTRACE.

2004-10-27 04:07  robert_dodier

	* Debugging.texi: Update, clarify, and expand descriptions of
	  functions for collecting timing statistics: TIMER, TIMER_INFO,
	  TIMER_DEVALUE (flag), and UNTIMER.

2004-10-26 04:46  robert_dodier

	* Debugging.texi: Update, expand, and clarify TRACE, TRACE_OPTIONS,
	  and UNTRACE.

2004-10-25 03:47  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Strike out out-of-date description of Lisp function
	  CONTINUE.  That function does still exist; it runs the main
	  interpreter loop.  However, it is superseded by TO-MAXIMA for the
	  purpose of exiting the Lisp debugger, and does not have any other
	  documented use at the user level.

	  Update and clarify description of FEATURE.

	  Update description of ROOM.

2004-10-24 22:13  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Updated description of STATUS function.

2004-10-24 18:58  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Strike out description of obsolete, nonexistent
	  function FILEDEFAULTS.

2004-10-24 17:57  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Update and slightly expand description of the TIME
	  function.

2004-10-24 17:32  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi: Strike out descriptions of obsolete variables and
	  functions: LASTTIME, TOBREAK, TOPLEVEL, TTYINTFUN, and TTYINTNUM.
	  About LASTTIME: it is assigned 0 (suprv1.lisp) but never
	  assigned another value. About TOBREAK: this function exists, but
	  it cannot behave in the manner described by the existing text
	  (namely as the return-to-debugger counterpart of TOPLEVEL).
	  TOBREAK branches on the value of a variable MBREAK, which is
	  never assigned a value other than nil. About TOPLEVEL: no such
	  function exists.  About TTYINTFUN: this variable cannot be
	  assigned a value (as its helper TTYINTFUNSETUP doesn't exist),
	  and it is never used.  About TTYINTNUM: this variable is never
	  used.  The code relating to these items remains untouched at this
	  time.

2004-10-23 02:17  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Remove descriptions of obsolete, nonexistent
	  functions ALLOC, DDT, DELFILE, and DISKFREE. Some declarations
	  still exist in the source code; no changes to source code at this
	  time.

2004-10-22 15:09  robert_dodier

	* Runtime.texi: Cut out descriptions of obsolete and nonexistent
	  functions ALARMCLOCK and BUG. In the source code, ALARMCLOCK is a
	  declared identifier but there is no code for that function, and
	  there is a commented-out definition of BUG. I didn't touch the
	  source code on this occasion.

2004-10-22 07:20  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi, Program.texi: Bring entries for DEBUGMODE and
	  BACKTRACE up to date.

2004-10-20 16:04  robert_dodier

	* Command.texi, Program.texi: Remove text for obsolete, nonexistent
	  functions LISPDEBUGMODE, DEBUGPRINTMODE, and DEBUG. There exist a
	  few nonfunctional references to these functions in the source
	  code; however I'll refrain from touching the code at this point.

2004-10-20 04:12  robert_dodier

	* Numerical.texi: Cut out stuff about 2-d arrays in descriptions of
	  FFT, IFT, RECTTOPOLAR, and POLARTORECT. Code
	  (.../share/numeric/fft.lisp) doesn't support 2-d arrays, so
	  when/if the functionality is added to fft.lisp we can just
	  restore the deleted text. Til then I guess I don't see reason to
	  advertise the capability for 2-d FFT.

2004-10-20 03:55  robert_dodier

	* Numerical.texi: Revised items for FFT, IFT, RECTTOPOLAR, and
	  POLARTORECT for greater clarity, accuracy, and slightly greater
	  breadth. IFT, RECTTOPOLAR, and POLARTORECT are listed in the FFT
	  text, but they have their own entries.  I've stated the formulas
	  for the forward and inverse transforms according to the observed
	  behavior of these functions (which doesn't match the description
	  given in .../share/numeric/fft.usg). -- These texts mention
	  2-dimensional arrays as arguments for these functions. It appears
	  the code (.../share/numeric/fft.lisp) is not equipped to handle
	  2-d arrays.

2004-10-20 03:44  robert_dodier

	* Simplification.texi: Cut out @findex and @vindex entries for
	  FACSUM, COLLECTTERMS, FACTORFACSUM, NEXTLAYERFACTOR, and
	  FACSUM_COMBINE. These were in the text for EXPAND.  These were
	  the only occurrences of @findex and @vindex in all the texi files
	  in maxima/doc/info/. The presence of these @findex and @vindex
	  entries made DESCRIBE print out spurious text for FACSUM, etc,
	  (namely all the text from there to the end of the file). FACSUM,
	  etc appear to be entirely undocumented, so DESCRIBE now returns
	  false for these items.

2004-10-17 23:35  robert_dodier

	* Input.texi: Updated and clarified documentation for STRINGOUT.

2004-10-17 04:18  robert_dodier

	* Operators.texi: Update documentation for RANDOM: describe the
	  function as it currently works, and cut out obsolete stuff.

2004-08-20 03:36  amundson

	* Plotting.texi: Add ticks to parametric examples. Fix typo.
	  Comment out broken ?draw2d example.

2004-08-20 02:11  amundson

	* Plotting.texi: Removed line breaks within strings to be sent to
	  gnuplot.

2004-07-24 18:06  amundson

	  documentation for make_transform.  3) fix references to
	  make_transform.

2004-07-23 14:16  amundson

	* Plotting.texi: Modify documentation for PLOT_OPTIONS to reflect
	  the many new gnuplot options. Entirely rewrote the PLOT_OPTIONS
	  section in an attempt to make it more coherent.

	  defined by testsuite.lisp. The manual now contains rudimentary
	  descriptions of run_testsuite, bug_report and build_info.

2004-03-14 21:54  amundson

	* Lists.texi: Add a space to eliminate a warning from texinfo.
