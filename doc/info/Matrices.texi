@subsection DOT
 - . The dot operator, for matrix (non-commutative)
multiplication.  When "." is used in this way, spaces should be left
on both sides of it, e.g. A . B.  This distinguishes it plainly from a
decimal point in a floating point number.  Do APROPOS(DOT); for a list
of the switches which affect the dot operator.

@node VECTORS, eigen, DOT, Introduction to Matrices and Linear Algebra
@subsection VECTORS
 - The file SHARE;VECT > contains a vector analysis package,
share/vect.dem contains a corresponding demonstration, and SHARE;VECT
ORTH contains definitions of various orthogonal curvilinear coordinate
systems.  LOAD(VECT); will load this package for you.
The vector analysis package can combine and simplify symbolic 
expressions including dot products and cross products, together with
the gradient, divergence, curl, and Laplacian operators.  The
distribution of these operators over sums or products is under
user control, as are various other expansions, including expansion
into components in any specific orthogonal coordinate systems.
There is also a capability for deriving the scalar or vector potential
of a field.
The package contains the following commands: VECTORSIMP, SCALEFACTORS,
EXPRESS, POTENTIAL, and VECTORPOTENTIAL.  Do DESCRIBE(cmd) on these
command names, or PRINTFILE(VECT,USAGE,SHARE); for details.
Warning:  The VECT package declares "." to be a commutative operator.

@node eigen, , VECTORS, Introduction to Matrices and Linear Algebra
@subsection eigen

The package @code{eigen} contains several functions devoted to the
symbolic computation of eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Maxima loads the package automatically if one of the functions
@code{eigenvalues} or @code{eigenvectors} is invoked.
The package may be loaded explicitly as @code{load ("eigen")}.

@code{demo ("eigen")} displays a demonstration of the capabilities
of this package.
@code{batch ("eigen")} executes the same demonstration,
but without the user prompt between successive computations.

The functions in the @code{eigen} package are
@code{conjugate}, @code{innerproduct}, @code{unitvector}, @code{columnvector},
@code{gramschmidt}, @code{eigenvalues}, @code{eigenvectors}, @code{uniteigenvectors},
and @code{similaritytransform}.

@code{load ("eigen")} loads this function.

@c FOLLOWING COMMENT PRESERVED. WHAT DOES THIS MEAN ??
This is useful if you want to use parts of the outputs of
the functions in this package in matrix calculations.

Example:

@c HMM, SPURIOUS "redefining the Macsyma function".
@c LEAVE IT HERE SINCE THAT'S WHAT A USER ACTUALLY SEES.
@example

@end defun

@defun copymatrix (@var{m})
Returns a copy of the matrix @var{m}.  This is the only way
to make a copy aside from copying @var{m} element by element.

Note that an assignment of one matrix to another, as in @code{m2: m1},
does not copy @code{m1}.
An assignment @code{m2 [i,j]: x} or @code{setelmx (x, i, j, m2} also modifies @code{m1 [i,j]}.
Creating a copy with @code{copymatrix} and then using assignment creates a separate, modified copy.

@c NEED EXAMPLE HERE
@end defun

@defun determinant (@var{m})
Computes the determinant of @var{m} by a method similar to
Gaussian elimination.

@c JUST HOW DOES ratmx AFFECT THE RESULT ??
The form of the result depends upon the setting
of the switch @code{ratmx}.

@c IS A SPARSE DETERMINANT SOMETHING OTHER THAN THE DETERMINANT OF A SPARSE MATRIX ??
There is a special routine for computing
sparse determinants which is called when the switches
@code{ratmx} and @code{sparse} are both @code{true}.

@c EXAMPLES NEEDED HERE
@end defun

@defvar detout
Default value: @code{false}

When @code{detout} is @code{true}, the determinant of a
matrix whose inverse is computed is factored out of the inverse.

For this switch to have an effect DOALLMXOPS and DOSCMXOPS should be
@code{false} (see their descriptions).  Alternatively this switch can be
given to EV which causes the other two to be set correctly.

Example:

@example
(%i1) m: matrix ([a, b], [c, d]);
                            [ a  b ]
(%o1)                       [      ]
                            [ c  d ]
(%i2) detout: true$
(%i3) doallmxops: false$
(%i4) doscmxops: false$
(%i5) invert (m);
                          [  d   - b ]
                          [          ]
                          [ - c   a  ]
(%o5)                     ------------
                           a d - b c
@end example
@c THERE'S MORE TO THIS STORY: detout: false$ invert (m); RETURNS THE SAME THING.
@c IT APPEARS THAT doallmxops IS CRUCIAL HERE.

@end defvar

@defun diagmatrix (@var{n}, @var{x})
Returns a diagonal matrix of size @var{n} by @var{n} with the
diagonal elements all equal to @var{x}.
@code{diagmatrix (@var{n}, 1)} returns an identity matrix (same as @code{ident (@var{n})}).

@var{n} must evaluate to an integer, otherwise @code{diagmatrix} complains with an error message.

@var{x} can be any kind of expression, including another matrix.
If @var{x} is a matrix, it is not copied; all diagonal elements refer to the same instance, @var{x}.

@c NEED EXAMPLE HERE

@defvar doallmxops

@defvar domxexpt
Default value: @code{true}

When @code{domxexpt} is @code{true},
a matrix exponential, @code{exp (@var{m})} where @var{m} is a matrix,
is interpreted as a matrix with element @code{[i,j} equal to @code{exp (m[i,j])}.
Otherwise @code{exp (@var{m})} evaluates to @code{exp (@var{ev(m)}}.

@code{domxexpt}
affects all expressions of the form @code{@var{base}^@var{power}} where @var{base} is an
expression assumed scalar or constant, and @var{power} is a list or
matrix.

@defvar domxmxops
Default value: @code{true}

When @code{domxmxops} is @code{true}, all matrix-matrix or

column elements under the first one in each row are all zero.

@defunx eivals (@var{m})
@c eigen.mac IS AUTOLOADED IF eigenvalues OR eigenvectors IS REFERENCED; EXTEND THAT TO ALL FUNCTIONS ??
@c EACH FUNCTION INTENDED FOR EXTERNAL USE SHOULD HAVE ITS OWN DOCUMENTATION ITEM
Returns a list of two lists containing the eigenvalues of the matrix @var{m}.
The first sublist of the return value is the list of eigenvalues of the
matrix, and the second sublist is the list of the
multiplicities of the eigenvalues in the corresponding order.

@code{eivals} is a synonym for @code{eigenvalues}.

@code{eigenvalues} calls the function @code{solve} to find the roots of the
characteristic polynomial of the matrix.
Sometimes @code{solve} may not be able to find the roots of the polynomial;
in that case some other functions in this
package (except @code{conjugate}, @code{innerproduct}, @code{unitvector}, @code{columnvector} and
@code{gramschmidt}) will not work.
@c WHICH ONES ARE THE FUNCTIONS WHICH DON'T WORK ??
@c ACTUALLY IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO LIST THE ONES WHICH DON'T WORK HERE

In some cases the eigenvalues found by @code{solve} may be complicated expressions.
(This may happen when @code{solve} returns a not-so-obviously real expression
for an eigenvalue which is known to be real.)
It may be possible to simplify the eigenvalues using some other functions.

@defun eigenvectors (@var{m})
@defunx eivects (@var{m})
takes a matrix @var{m} as its argument and returns a list
of lists the first sublist of which is the output of @code{eigenvalues}
and the other sublists of which are the eigenvectors of the
matrix corresponding to those eigenvalues respectively.
The calculated eigenvectors and the unit eigenvectors of the matrix are the
right eigenvectors and the right unit eigenvectors respectively.

@code{eivects} is a synonym for @code{eigenvectors}.

The package @code{eigen.mac} is loaded automatically when
@code{eigenvalues} or @code{eigenvectors} is referenced.
If @code{eigen.mac} is not already loaded,
@code{load ("eigen")} loads it.
After loading, all functions and variables in the package are available.

The flags that affect this function are:

@code{nondiagonalizable} is set to @code{true} or @code{false} depending on
whether the matrix is nondiagonalizable or diagonalizable after
@code{eigenvectors} returns.

@code{hermitianmatrix} when @code{true}, causes the degenerate
eigenvectors of the Hermitian matrix to be orthogonalized using the
Gram-Schmidt algorithm.

@code{knowneigvals} when @code{true} causes the @code{eigen} package to assume the
eigenvalues of the matrix are known to the user and stored under the
global name @code{listeigvals}.  @code{listeigvals} should be set to a list similar
to the output @code{eigenvalues}.

The function @code{algsys} is used here to solve for the eigenvectors. Sometimes if the
eigenvalues are messy, @code{algsys} may not be able to find a solution.
In some cases, it may be possible to simplify the eigenvalues by
first finding them using @code{eigenvalues} command and then using other functions
to reduce them to something simpler.
Following simplification, @code{eigenvectors} can be called again
with the @code{knowneigvals} flag set to @code{true}.

may be omitted. If j1=i1=1 then i1 and j1 may both be omitted. If a
selected element of the array doesn't exist a symbolic one will be
used.

@defun gramschmidt (x)
@defunx gschmit (x)
a function in the EIGEN package.  Do LOAD(EIGEN) to
use it.  GRAMSCHMIDT takes a LIST of lists the sublists of which are
of equal length and not necessarily orthogonal (with respect to the
innerproduct defined above) as its argument and returns a similar list
each sublist of which is orthogonal to all others.  (Returned results
may contain integers that are factored.  This is due to the fact that
the function FACTOR is used to simplify each substage of the
Gram-Schmidt algorithm.  This prevents the expressions from getting
very messy and helps to reduce the sizes of the numbers that are
produced along the way.)

@code{gschmit} (note spelling) is a synonym for @code{gramschmidt}.

@end defun

@defun hach (a,b,m,n,l)
An implementation of Hacijan's linear programming
algorithm is available by doing BATCH("kach.mc"$.  Details of use
are available by doing BATCH("kach.dem");

@end defun

@defun ident (n)
produces an n by n identity matrix.

@end defun

@defun innerproduct (x,y)
@defunx inprod (x, y)
a function in the EIGEN package.  Do LOAD(EIGEN)
to use it.  INNERPRODUCT takes two LISTS of equal length as its
arguments and returns their inner (scalar) product defined by (Complex
Conjugate of X).Y (The "dot" operation is the same as the usual one
defined for vectors).

@code{inprod} is a synonym for @code{innerproduct}.

@end defun

@defun invert (matrix)
finds the inverse of a matrix using the adjoint
method.  This allows a user to compute the inverse of a matrix with
bfloat entries or polynomials with floating pt. coefficients without
converting to cre-form.  The DETERMINANT command is used to compute
cofactors, so if RATMX is @code{false} (the default) the inverse is computed
without changing the representation of the elements.  The current
implementation is inefficient for matrices of high order.
The DETOUT flag if true keeps the determinant factored out of the
inverse.
Note: the results are not automatically expanded.  If the matrix
originally had polynomial entries, better appearing output can be
generated by EXPAND(INVERT(mat)),DETOUT.  If it is desirable to then
divide through by the determinant this can be accomplished by XTHRU(%)
or alternatively from scratch by
EXPAND(ADJOINT(mat))/EXPAND(DETERMINANT(mat)).
INVERT(mat):=ADJOINT(mat)/DETERMINANT(mat).
See also DESCRIBE("^^"); for another method of inverting a matrix.

@end defun

@defvar lmxchar
 default: [[] - The character used to display the (left)
delimiter of a matrix (see also RMXCHAR).

@end defvar

@defun matrix (row1, ..., rown)
defines a rectangular matrix with the
indicated rows.  Each row has the form of a list of expressions, e.g.
[A, X**2, Y, 0] is a list of 4 elements.  There are a number of
commands which deal with matrices, for example:  DETERMINANT,
CHARPOLY, GENMATRIX, ADDCOL, ADDROW, COPYMATRIX, TRANSPOSE, ECHELON,
and RANK.  There is also a package on the SHARE directory for 
computing EIGENVALUES.  Try DESCRIBE on these for more information.
Matrix multiplication is effected by using the dot operator, ".",
which is also convenient if the user wishes to represent other
non-commutative algebraic operations.  The exponential of the "."
operation is "^^" .
Thus, for a matrix A, A.A = A^^2 and, if it exists, A^^-1 is the
inverse of A.
The operations +,-,*,** are all element-by-element operations; all
operations are normally carried out in full, including the . (dot)
operation.  Many switches exist for controlling simplification rules
involving dot and matrix-list operations.
Options Relating to Matrices:
LMXCHAR, RMXCHAR, RATMX, LISTARITH, DETOUT, DOALLMXOPS, DOMXEXPT
DOMXMXOPS, DOSCMXOPS, DOSCMXPLUS, SCALARMATRIX, and SPARSE.
Do DESCRIBE(option) for details on them.

@end defun

@defun matrixmap (fn, m)
will map the function fn onto each element of the
matrix M.

@end defun

@defun matrixp (exp)
is @code{true} if exp is a matrix else @code{false}.

@end defun

@defvar matrix_element_add
 default: [+] - May be set to "?"; may also be the
name of a function, or a LAMBDA expression.  In this way, a rich
variety of algebraic structures may be simulated.  For more details,
do DEMO("matrix.dem1"); and DEMO("matrix.dem2");.

@end defvar

@defvar matrix_element_mult
 default: [*] - May be set to "."; may also be the
name of a function, or a LAMBDA expression.  In this way, a rich
variety of algebraic structures may be simulated.  For more details,
do DEMO("matrix.dem1"); and DEMO("matrix.dem2");

@end defvar

@defvar matrix_element_transpose
 default: @code{false} - Other useful settings are
TRANSPOSE and NONSCALARS; may also be the name of a function, or a
LAMBDA expression.  In this way, a rich variety of algebraic
structures may be simulated.  For more details, do
DEMO("matrix.dem1"); and DEMO("matrix.dem2");.

@end defvar

@defun mattrace (m)
computes the trace [sum of the elements on the main diagonal] of
the square matrix M.  It is used by NCHARPOLY, an alternative to Maxima's
CHARPOLY.  It is used by doing LOADFILE("nchrpl");

@end defun

@defun minor (m, i, j)
computes the i,j minor of the matrix M.  That is, M
with row i and column j removed.

@end defun

@defun ncexpt (a,b)
if an (non-commutative) exponential expression is too
wide to be displayed as A^^B it will appear as NCEXPT(A,B).

@end defun

@defun ncharpoly (m,var)
finds the characteristic polynomial of the matrix M
with respect to var.  This is an alternative to Maxima's CHARPOLY.
NCHARPOLY works by computing traces of powers of the given matrix,
which are known to be equal to sums of powers of the roots of the
characteristic polynomial.  From these quantities the symmetric
functions of the roots can be calculated, which are nothing more than
the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial.  CHARPOLY works by
forming the determinant of VAR * IDENT [N] - A.  Thus NCHARPOLY wins,
for example, in the case of large dense matrices filled with integers,
since it avoids polynomial arithmetic altogether.  It may be used by
doing LOADFILE("nchrpl");

@end defun

@defun newdet (m,n)
also computes the determinant of M but uses the
Johnson-Gentleman tree minor algorithm.  M may be the name of a
matrix or array.  The argument n is the order; it is optional if M is
a matrix.

@end defun

@defvr declaration nonscalar
 - makes ai behave as does a list or matrix with respect to
the dot operator.

@end defvr

@defun nonscalarp (exp)
is @code{true} if exp is a non-scalar, i.e.  it contains
atoms declared as non-scalars, lists, or matrices.

@end defun

@defun permanent (m,n)
computes the permanent of the matrix M.  A permanent
is like a determinant but with no sign changes.

@end defun

@defun rank (m)
computes the rank of the matrix M.  That is, the order of the
largest non-singular subdeterminant of M.  Caveat: RANK may return the
wrong answer if it cannot determine that a matrix element that is
equivalent to zero is indeed so.

@end defun

@defvar ratmx
 default: @code{false} - if @code{false} will cause determinant and matrix
addition, subtraction, and multiplication to be performed in the
representation of the matrix elements and will cause the result of
matrix inversion to be left in general representation.  If it is @code{true},
the 4 operations mentioned above will be performed in CRE form and the
result of matrix inverse will be in CRE form.  Note that this may
cause the elements to be expanded (depending on the setting of RATFAC)
which might not always be desired.

@end defvar

@defun row (m, i)
gives a matrix of the ith row of matrix M.

@end defun

@defvar scalarmatrixp
 default: @code{true} - if @code{true}, then whenever a 1 x 1 matrix
is produced as a result of computing the dot product of matrices it
will be converted to a scalar, namely the only element of the matrix.
If set to ALL, then this conversion occurs whenever a 1 x 1 matrix is
simplified.  If set to @code{false}, no conversion will be done.

@end defvar

@c MOVED scalefactors HERE FROM Miscellaneous.texi, SEEMS MORE AT HOME HERE
@defun scalefactors (coordinatetransform)
Here coordinatetransform
evaluates to the form [[expression1, expression2, ...],
indeterminate1, indeterminat2, ...], where indeterminate1,
indeterminate2, etc. are the curvilinear coordinate variables and
where a set of rectangular Cartesian components is given in terms of
the curvilinear coordinates by [expression1, expression2, ...].
@code{coordinates} is set to the vector [indeterminate1, indeterminate2,...],
and @code{dimension} is set to the length of this vector.  SF[1], SF[2],
..., SF[DIMENSION] are set to the coordinate scale factors, and @code{sfprod}
is set to the product of these scale factors.  Initially, @code{coordinates}
is [X, Y, Z], @code{dimension} is 3, and SF[1]=SF[2]=SF[3]=SFPROD=1,
corresponding to 3-dimensional rectangular Cartesian coordinates.
To expand an expression into physical components in the current
coordinate system, there is a function with usage of the form

@end defun

@defun setelmx (x, i, j, m)
changes the i,j element of M to x.  The altered
matrix is returned as the value.  The notation M[i,j]:x may also be
used, altering M in a similar manner, but returning x as the value.

@end defun

@defun similaritytransform (mat)
@defunx simtran (mat)
a function in the EIGEN package.  Do
LOAD(EIGEN) to use it.  SIMILARITYTRANSFORM takes a MATRIX as its
argument and returns a list which is the output of the
UNITEIGENVECTORS command.  In addition if the flag NONDIAGONALIZABLE
is @code{false} two global matrices LEFTMATRIX and RIGHTMATRIX will be
generated.  These matrices have the property that
LEFTMATRIX.MAT.RIGHTMATRIX is a diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues
of MAT on the diagonal.  If NONDIAGONALIZABLE is @code{true} these two
matrices will not be generated.  If the flag HERMITIANMATRIX is @code{true}
then LEFTMATRIX is the complex conjugate of the transpose of
RIGHTMATRIX.  Otherwise LEFTMATRIX is the inverse of RIGHTMATRIX.
RIGHTMATRIX is the matrix the columns of which are the unit
eigenvectors of MAT.  The other flags (see DESCRIBE(EIGENVALUES); and
DESCRIBE(EIGENVECTORS);) have the same effects since
SIMILARITYTRANSFORM calls the other functions in the package in order
to be able to form RIGHTMATRIX.

@code{simtran} is a synonym for @code{similaritytransform}.

@end defun

@defvar sparse
 default: @code{false} - if @code{true} and if RATMX:TRUE then DETERMINANT
will use special routines for computing sparse determinants.

@end defun

@defun triangularize (m)
produces the upper triangular form of the matrix M
which needn't be square.

@end defun

@defun uniteigenvectors (mat)
@defunx ueivects (mat)
a function in the EIGEN package.  Do
LOAD(EIGEN) to use it.  UNITEIGENVECTORS takes a MATRIX as its
argument and returns a list of lists the first sublist of which is the
output of the EIGENVALUES command and the other sublists of which are
the unit eigenvectors of the matrix corresponding to those eigenvalues
respectively.  The flags mentioned in the description of the
EIGENVECTORS command have the same effects in this one as well.  In
addition there is a flag which may be useful :
KNOWNEIGVECTS - If set to @code{true} the EIGEN package will assume
that the eigenvectors of the matrix are known to the user and are
stored under the global name LISTEIGVECTS.  LISTEIGVECTS should be set
to a list similar to the output of the EIGENVECTORS command.  (If
KNOWNEIGVECTS is set to @code{true} and the list of eigenvectors is given the
setting of the flag NONDIAGONALIZABLE may not be correct.  If that is
the case please set it to the correct value.  The author assumes that
the user knows what he is doing and will not try to diagonalize a
matrix the eigenvectors of which do not span the vector space of the
appropriate dimension...)

@code{ueivects} is a synonym for @code{uniteigenvectors}.

@end defun

@defun unitvector (x)
@defunx uvect (x)
a function in the EIGEN package.  Do LOAD(EIGEN) to
use it.  UNITVECTOR takes a LIST as its argument and returns a unit
list.  (i.e. a list with unit magnitude).

@code{uvect} is a synonym for @code{unitvector}.

@end defun

@defun vectorsimp (vectorexpression)
This function employs additional
simplifications, together with various optional
expansions according to the settings of the following global flags:

@example
EXPANDALL, EXPANDDOT, EXPANDDOTPLUS, EXPANDCROSS, EXPANDCROSSPLUS,
EXPANDCROSSCROSS, EXPANDGRAD, EXPANDGRADPLUS, EXPANDGRADPROD,
EXPANDDIV, EXPANDDIVPLUS, EXPANDDIVPROD, EXPANDCURL, EXPANDCURLPLUS,
EXPANDCURLCURL, EXPANDLAPLACIAN, EXPANDLAPLACIANPLUS,
EXPANDLAPLACIANPROD.
@end example

All these flags have default value @code{false}. The PLUS suffix refers to
employing additivity or distributivity.  The PROD suffix refers to the
expansion for an operand that is any kind of product.
EXPANDCROSSCROSS refers to replacing p~(q~r) with (p.r)*q-(p.q)*r, and
EXPANDCURLCURL refers to replacing CURL CURL p with GRAD DIV p + DIV
GRAD p.  EXPANDCROSS:TRUE has the same effect as
EXPANDCROSSPLUS:EXPANDCROSSCROSS:TRUE, etc.  Two other flags,
EXPANDPLUS and EXPANDPROD, have the same effect as setting all
similarly suffixed flags true.  When @code{true}, another flag named
EXPANDLAPLACIANTODIVGRAD, replaces the LAPLACIAN operator with the
composition DIV GRAD.  All of these flags are initially @code{false}.  For
convenience, all of these flags have been declared EVFLAG.
For orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, the global variables
COORDINATES[[X,Y,Z]], DIMENSION[3], SF[[1,1,1]], and SFPROD[1] are set
by the function invocation
