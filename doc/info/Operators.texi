@section NARY
 - An NARY operator is used to denote a function of any number of
arguments, each of which is separated by an occurrence of the
operator, e.g. A+B or A+B+C.  The NARY("x") function is a syntax
extension function to declare x to be an NARY operator.  Do
DESCRIBE(SYNTAX); for more details.  Functions may be DECLAREd to be
NARY.  If DECLARE(J,NARY); is done, this tells the simplifier to
simplify, e.g. J(J(A,B),J(C,D)) to J(A, B, C, D).

@node NOFIX, OPERATOR, NARY, Operators
@section NOFIX
 - NOFIX operators are used to denote functions of no arguments.
The mere presence of such an operator in a command will cause the
corresponding function to be evaluated.  For example, when one types
"exit;" to exit from a MACSYMA break, "exit" is behaving similar to a
NOFIX operator.  The function NOFIX("x") is a syntax extension
function which declares x to be a NOFIX operator.  Do
DESCRIBE(SYNTAX); for more details.

@node OPERATOR, POSTFIX, NOFIX, Operators
@section OPERATOR
 - See OPERATORS

@node POSTFIX, PREFIX, OPERATOR, Operators
@section POSTFIX
 - POSTFIX operators like the PREFIX variety denote functions
of a single argument, but in this case the argument immediately
precedes an occurrence of the operator in the input string, e.g. 3! .
The POSTFIX("x") function is a syntax extension function to declare x
to be a POSTFIX operator.  Do DESCRIBE(SYNTAX); for details.

@node PREFIX, Definitions for Operators, POSTFIX, Operators
@section PREFIX
 - A PREFIX operator is one which signifies a function of one
argument, which argument immediately follows an occurrence of the
operator.  PREFIX("x") is a syntax extension function to declare x to
be a PREFIX operator.  Do DESCRIBE(SYNTAX); for more details.

@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "!"
The factorial operator, which is the product of all the integers
from 1 up to its argument.  Thus 5! = 1*2*3*4*5 = 120.  The value of
/the option FACTLIM (default: [-1]) gives the highest factorial which is
automatically expanded.  If it is -1 then all integers are expanded.
See also the FACTORIAL, MINFACTORIAL, and FACTCOMB commands.

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "!!"
Stands for double factorial which is defined as the product of
all the consecutive odd (or even) integers from 1 (or 2) to the odd
(or even) argument.  Thus 8!! is 2*4*6*8 = 384.

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "#"
The logical operator "Not equals".

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "."
The dot operator, for matrix (non-commutative) multiplication.
When "." is used in this way, spaces should be left on both sides of
it, e.g. A . B.  This distinguishes it plainly from a decimal point in
a floating point number.  Do APROPOS(DOT); for a list of the switches
which affect the dot operator.  DESCRIBE(switch-name); will explain
them.

@end deffn
@c @node operator

@deffn operator ":"
The assignment operator.  E.g. A:3 sets the variable A to 3.

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "::"
Assignment operator.  :: assigns the value of the expression
on its right to the value of the quantity on its left, which must
evaluate to an atomic variable or subscripted variable.

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@deffn operator "::="
The "::=" is used instead of ":=" to indicate that what
follows is a macro definition, rather than an ordinary functional
definition.  See DESCRIBE(MACROS).

@end deffn

@deffn operator ":="
The function definition operator.  E.g. F(X):=SIN(X) defines
a function F.

@end deffn
@c @node operator
@c @unnumberedsec phony

@c @node ADDITIVE
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defvr {special symbol} ADDITIVE
 - If DECLARE(F,ADDITIVE) has been executed, then:
(1) If F is univariate, whenever the simplifier encounters F applied
to a sum, F will be distributed over that sum.  I.e. F(Y+X); will
simplify to F(Y)+F(X).
(2) If F is a function of 2 or more arguments, additivity is defined as 
additivity in the first argument to F, as in the case of 'SUM or 
'INTEGRATE, i.e. F(H(X)+G(X),X); will simplify to F(H(X),X)+F(G(X),X).
This simplification does not occur when F is applied to expressions of
the form SUM(X[I],I,lower-limit,upper-limit).

@end defvr
@c @node keyword
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defvr keyword ALLBUT
 works with the PART commands (i.e. PART, INPART, SUBSTPART,
SUBSTINPART, DPART, and LPART).  For example,

@example
if EXPR is E+D+C+B+A,
then PART(EXPR,[2,5]);
==> D+A
@end example

while
@example
PART(EXPR,ALLBUT(2,5))==>E+C+B
@end example

It also works with the KILL command,
@example
KILL(ALLBUT(name1,...,namek))
@end example

will do a KILL(ALL) except it will not
KILL the names specified.  Note: namei means a name such as function
name such as U, F, FOO, or G, not an infolist such as FUNCTIONS.


@end defvr
@c @node declaration
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defvr declaration ANTISYMMETRIC
 - If DECLARE(H,ANTISYMMETRIC); is done, this tells the
simplifier that H is antisymmetric.  E.g. H(X,Z,Y) will simplify to -
H(X, Y, Z).  That is, it will give (-1)^n times the result given by
SYMMETRIC or COMMUTATIVE, where n is the number of interchanges of two
arguments necessary to convert it to that form.

@c @node ENTIER
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun ENTIER (X)
largest integer <= X where X is numeric.  FIX (as in
FIXnum) is a synonym for this, so FIX(X); is precisely the same.

@end defun
@c @node EQUAL
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun EQUAL (expr1,expr2)
used with an "IS", returns TRUE (or FALSE) if
and only if expr1 and expr2 are equal (or not equal) for all possible
values of their variables (as determined by RATSIMP).  Thus
IS(EQUAL((X+1)**2,X**2+2*X+1)) returns TRUE whereas if X is unbound
IS((X+1)**2=X**2+2*X+1) returns FALSE.  Note also that IS(RAT(0)=0)
gives FALSE but IS(EQUAL(RAT(0),0)) gives TRUE.  If a determination
can't be made with EQUAL then a simplified but equivalent form is
returned whereas = always causes either TRUE or FALSE to be returned.
All variables occurring in exp are presumed to be real valued.
EV(exp,PRED) is equivalent to IS(exp).
@example
(C1) IS(X**2 >= 2*X-1);
(D1)                               TRUE
(C2) ASSUME(A>1);

@c @node FULLMAP
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun FULLMAP (fn, exp1, ...)
is similar to MAP but it will keep mapping
down all subexpressions until the main operators are no longer the
same.  The user should be aware that FULLMAP is used by the MACSYMA
simplifier for certain matrix manipulations; thus, the user might see
an error message concerning FULLMAP even though FULLMAP was not
explicitly called by the user.
@example
(C1) A+B*C$
(C2) FULLMAP(G,%);
(D2)              G(B) G(C) + G(A)
(C3)  MAP(G,D1);

@end example
@end defun
@c @node IS
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun IS (exp)
attempts to determine whether exp (which must evaluate to a
predicate) is provable from the facts in the current data base.  IS
returns TRUE if the predicate is true for all values of its variables
consistent with the data base and returns FALSE if it is false for all
such values.  Otherwise, its action depends on the setting of the
switch PREDERROR (default: TRUE). IS errs out if the value of
PREDERROR is TRUE and returns UNKNOWN if PREDERROR is FALSE.

@end defun
@c @node ISQRT

@deffn operator PRED
 (EVFLAG) causes predicates (expressions which evaluate to TRUE
or FALSE) to be evaluated.

@end deffn
@c @node RANDOM
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun RANDOM (X)
returns a random integer between 0 and X-1.  If no
argument is given then a random integer between -2^(29) and 2^(29) -1
is returned.  If X is FALSE then the random sequence is restarted from
the beginning.
Note that the range of the returned result when no argument is given
differs in NIL MACSYMA from that of PDP-10 and Multics MACSYMA, which
is -2^(35) to 2^(35) -1.  This range is the range of the FIXNUM
datatype of the underlying LISP.

@end defun
@c @node SIGN
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SIGN (exp)
attempts to determine the sign of its specified expression
on the basis of the facts in the current data base.  It returns one of
the following answers: POS (positive), NEG (negative), ZERO, PZ
(positive or zero), NZ (negative or zero), PN (positive or negative),
or PNZ (positive, negative, or zero, i.e. nothing known).

@end defun
@c @node SIGNUM
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SIGNUM (X)
if X<0 then -1 else if X>0 then 1 else 0.  If X is not
numeric then a simplified but equivalent form is returned. For
example, SIGNUM(-X) gives -SIGNUM(X).

@end defun
@c @node SORT
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SORT (list,optional-predicate)
sorts the list using a suitable
optional-predicate of two arguments (such as "<" or ORDERLESSP).  If
the optional-predicate is not given, then MACSYMA's built-in ordering
predicate is used.

@end defun
@c @node SQRT
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SQRT (X)
the square root of X. It is represented internally by
X^(1/2).  Also see ROOTSCONTRACT.
RADEXPAND[TRUE] - if TRUE will cause nth roots of factors of a product
which are powers of n to be pulled outside of the radical, e.g.
SQRT(16*X^2) will become 4*X only if RADEXPAND is TRUE.

@end defun

@end defvar
@c @node SUBLIS
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SUBLIS (list,expr)
allows multiple substitutions into an expression in

@example
        SUBLIS([A=B,B=A],SIN(A)+COS(B));
         => SIN(B) + COS(A)
@end example
The variable SUBLIS_APPLY_LAMBDA[TRUE] controls simplification after
SUBLIS.  For full documentation, see the file SHARE2;SUBLIS INFO.

@end defun
@c @node SUBLIST
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SUBLIST (L,F)
returns the list of elements of the list L for which the

[2,4].

@end defun
@c @node SUBLIS_APPLY_LAMBDA
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defvar SUBLIS_APPLY_LAMBDA
 default:[TRUE] - controls whether LAMBDA's

whether you have to do an EV to get things to apply. TRUE means do the
application.

@end defvar
@c @node SUBST
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SUBST (a, b, c)
substitutes a for b in c.  b must be an atom, or a
complete subexpression of c.  For example, X+Y+Z is a complete
subexpression of 2*(X+Y+Z)/W while X+Y is not. When b does not have
these characteristics, one may sometimes use SUBSTPART or RATSUBST
(see below).  Alternatively, if b is of the form e/f then one could
use SUBST(a*f,e,c) while if b is of the form e**(1/f) then one could
use SUBST(a**f,e,c).  The SUBST command also discerns the X^Y in X^-Y
so that SUBST(A,SQRT(X),1/SQRT(X)) yields 1/A.  a and b may also be
operators of an expression enclosed in "s or they may be function
names.  If one wishes to substitute for the independent variable in
derivative forms then the AT function (see below) should be used.
Note:  SUBST is an alias for SUBSTITUTE.
SUBST(eq1,exp) or SUBST([eq1,...,eqk],exp) are other permissible
forms.  The eqi are equations indicating substitutions to be made.
For each equation, the right side will be substituted for the left in
the expression exp.
EXPTSUBST[FALSE] if TRUE permits substitutions like Y for %E**X in
%E**(A*X) to take place.
OPSUBST[TRUE] if FALSE, SUBST will not attempt to substitute into the
operator of an expression.  E.g. (OPSUBST:FALSE, SUBST(X^2,R,R+R[0]));
will work.
@example
(C1) SUBST(A,X+Y,X+(X+Y)**2+Y);
                                 2
(D1)                    Y + X + A
(C2) SUBST(-%I,%I,A+B*%I);
(D2)                             A - %I B

(Note that C2 is one way of obtaining the complex conjugate of an analytic
expression.)  For further examples, do EXAMPLE(SUBST);

@end defun
@c @node SUBSTINPART
@c @unnumberedsec phony
@defun SUBSTINPART (x, exp, n1, ...)
is like SUBSTPART but works on the

                                   2

(C3) SUBSTINPART(F1,F[1](X+1),0);
(D3)                            F1(X + 1)
              Additional Information
If the last argument to a part function is a list of indices then
several subexpressions are picked out, each one corresponding to an
index of the list.  Thus
@example
(C1) PART(X+Y+Z,[1,3]);
(D1) Z+X
@end example
PIECE holds the value of the last expression selected when using the
part functions.  It is set during the execution of the function and
thus may be referred to in the function itself as shown below.
If PARTSWITCH[FALSE] is set to TRUE then END is returned when a
selected part of an expression doesn't exist, otherwise an error

numerator and denominator to be canceled thus simplifying the
expression to be RATSIMPed.

var is equivalent to zero.  It returns either TRUE, FALSE, or
DONTKNOW.  For example ZEROEQUIV(SIN(2*X) - 2*SIN(X)*COS(X),X) returns
TRUE and ZEROEQUIV(%E^X+X,X) returns FALSE.  On the other hand
ZEROEQUIV(LOG(A*B) - LOG(A) - LOG(B),A) will return DONTKNOW because
of the presence of an extra parameter.  The restrictions are:
(1) Do not use functions that MACSYMA does not know how to
differentiate and evaluate.
(2) If the expression has poles on the real line, there may be errors
in the result (but this is unlikely to occur).
(3) If the expression contains functions which are not solutions to
first order differential equations (e.g.  Bessel functions) there may
be incorrect results.
(4) The algorithm uses evaluation at randomly chosen points for
carefully selected subexpressions.  This is always a somewhat
hazardous business, although the algorithm tries to minimize the
potential for error.
