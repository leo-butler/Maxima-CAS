@defun BERN (x)
gives the Xth Bernoulli number for integer X.
ZEROBERN[TRUE] if set to FALSE excludes the zero BERNOULLI numbers.
(See also BURN).

@end defun

@defun BERNPOLY (v, n)
generates the nth Bernoulli polynomial in the
variable v.

@end defun

@defun BFZETA (exp,n)
BFLOAT version of the Riemann Zeta function.  The 2nd
argument is how many digits to retain and return, it's a good idea to
request a couple of extra.  This function is available by doing
LOAD(BFFAC); .

@end defun

@defun BGZETA (S, FPPREC)
BGZETA is like BZETA, but avoids arithmetic
overflow errors on large arguments, is faster on medium size arguments
(say S=55, FPPREC=69), and is slightly slower on small arguments.  It
may eventually replace BZETA.  BGZETA is available by doing
LOAD(BFAC);.

@end defun

@defun BHZETA (S,H,FPPREC)
gives FPPREC digits of
@example
SUM((K+H)^-S,K,0,INF)
@end example
This is available by doing LOAD(BFFAC);.

@end defun

@defun BINOMIAL (X, Y)
the binomial coefficient X*(X-1)*...*(X-Y+1)/Y!. If X
and Y are integers, then the numerical value of the binomial
coefficient is computed.  If Y, or the value X-Y, is an integer, the
binomial coefficient is expressed as a polynomial.

@end defun

@defun BURN (N)
is like BERN(N), but without computing all of the uncomputed
Bernoullis of smaller index.  So BURN works efficiently for large,
isolated N.  (BERN(402) takes about 645 secs vs 13.5 secs for
BURN(402).  BERN's time growth seems to be exponential, while BURN's
is about cubic.  But if next you do BERN(404), it only takes 12 secs,
since BERN remembers all in an array, whereas BURN(404) will take
maybe 14 secs or maybe 25, depending on whether Maxima needs to
BFLOAT a better value of %PI.)  BURN is available by doing LOAD(BFFAC);.
BURN uses an observation of WGD that (rational) Bernoulli numbers can be
approximated by (transcendental) zetas with tolerable efficiency.

@end defun

@defun BZETA
 - This function is obsolete, see BFZETA.

@end defun

@defun CF (exp)
converts exp into a continued fraction.  exp is an expression
composed of arithmetic operators and lists which represent continued
fractions.  A continued fraction a+1/(b+1/(c+...)) is represented by
the list [a,b,c,...]. a,b,c,.. must be integers.  Exp may also involve
SQRT(n) where n is an integer.  In this case CF will give as many
terms of the continued fraction as the value of the variable
CFLENGTH[1] times the period.  Thus the default is to give one period.
(CF binds LISTARITH to FALSE so that it may carry out its function.)

@end defun

@defun CFDISREP (list)
converts the continued fraction represented by list
into general representation.
@example
(%i1) CF([1,2,-3]+[1,-2,1]);
(%o1)                 [1, 1, 1, 2]
(%i2) CFDISREP(%);
                            1
(%o2)                1 + ---------
                              1
                        1 + -----
                                1
                            1 + -
                                2


@end example
@end defun

@defun CFEXPAND (x)
gives a matrix of the numerators and denominators of the
next-to-last and last convergents of the continued fraction x.
@example
(%i1) CF(SQRT(3));
(%o1)                 [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1]
(%i2) CFEXPAND(%);
                             [71  97]
(%o2)                         [      ]
                             [41  56]
(%i3) %o2[1,2]/%o2[2,2],NUMER;
(%o3)                        1.7321429


@end example
@end defun

@defvar CFLENGTH
 default: [1] controls the number of terms of the continued
fraction the function CF will give, as the value CFLENGTH[1] times the
period.  Thus the default is to give one period.

@end defvar

@defun DIVSUM (n,k)
adds up all the factors of n raised to the kth power.  If
only one argument is given then k is assumed to be 1.

@end defun

@defun EULER (X)
gives the Xth Euler number for integer X.  For the
Euler-Mascheroni constant, see %GAMMA.

@end defun

@defun factorial (X)
The factorial function. Maxima treats @code{factorial (x)} the same as @code{x!}.
See @code{!}.

@end defun

@defun FIB (X)
the Xth Fibonacci number with FIB(0)=0, FIB(1)=1, and
FIB(-N)=(-1)^(N+1) *FIB(N).  PREVFIB is FIB(X-1), the Fibonacci number
preceding the last one computed.

@end defun

@defun FIBTOPHI (exp)
converts FIB(n) to its closed form definition.
This involves the constant %PHI (= (SQRT(5)+1)/2 = 1.618033989).
If you want the Rational Function Package to know 
About %PHI do TELLRAT(%PHI^2-%PHI-1)$  ALGEBRAIC:TRUE$ .

@end defun

@defun INRT (X,n)
takes two integer arguments, X and n, and returns the
integer nth root of the absolute value of X.

@end defun

@defun JACOBI (p,q)
is the Jacobi symbol of p and q.

@end defun

@defun LCM (exp1,exp2,...)
returns the Least Common Multiple of its arguments.
Do LOAD(FUNCTS); to access this function.

@end defun

@defvar MAXPRIME
 default: [489318] - the largest number which may be given to
the PRIME(n) command, which returns the nth prime.

@end defvar

@defun MINFACTORIAL (exp)
examines exp for occurrences of two factorials
which differ by an integer.  It then turns one into a polynomial times
the other.  If exp involves binomial coefficients then they will be
converted into ratios of factorials.
@example
(%i1) N!/(N+1)!;
                                    N!
(%o1)                             --------
                                 (N + 1)!
(%i2) MINFACTORIAL(%);
                                     1
(%o2)                               -----
                                   N + 1


@end example
@end defun

@defun PARTFRAC (exp, var)
expands the expression exp in partial fractions
with respect to the main variable, var.  PARTFRAC does a complete
partial fraction decomposition.  The algorithm employed is based on
the fact that the denominators of the partial fraction expansion (the
factors of the original denominator) are relatively prime.  The
numerators can be written as linear combinations of denominators, and
the expansion falls out.  See EXAMPLE(PARTFRAC); for examples.

@end defun

@defun PRIME (n)
gives the nth prime. MAXPRIME[489318] is the largest number
accepted as argument.  Note:  The PRIME command does not work in
Maxima, since it required a large file of primes, which most users
do not want.    PRIMEP does work however.

@end defun

@defun PRIMEP (n)
returns TRUE if n is a prime, FALSE if not.

@end defun

@defun QUNIT (n)
gives the principal unit of the real quadratic number field
SQRT(n) where n is an integer, i.e.  the element whose norm is unity.
This amounts to solving Pell's equation A**2- n*B**2=1.
@example
(%i1) QUNIT(17);
(%o1)              SQRT(17)+4
(%i2)  EXPAND(%*(SQRT(17)-4));
(%o2)               1


@end example
@end defun

@defun TOTIENT (n)
is the number of integers less than or equal to n which
are relatively prime to n.

@end defun

@defvar ZEROBERN
 default: [TRUE] - if set to FALSE excludes the zero
BERNOULLI numbers.  (See the BERN function.)

@end defvar

@defun ZETA (X)
gives the Riemann zeta function for certain integer values
of X.

@end defun

@defvar ZETA%PI
 default: [TRUE] - if FALSE, suppresses ZETA(n) giving
coeff*%PI^n for n even.

@end defvar
