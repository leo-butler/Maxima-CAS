@deffn {function} array (name, dim1, dim2, ..., dimk)
@deffnx {function} array (name, type, dim1, dim2, ..., dimk)
This sets up a @var{k}-dimensional array.  
A maximum of five dimensions may be used.  In the first form, a
general array is created.  In the second form, an array meant to have
elements of the specified type is created.  @var{type} can be @code{fixnum} for
integers of limited size or @code{flonum} for floating-point numbers.

The subscripts for
the @var{i}th dimension are the integers running from 0 to @var{dimi}.  
If the user assigns to a subscripted variable before declaring the
corresponding array, an undeclared array is set up.  If the user has
more than one array to be set up the same way, they may all be set up
at the same time, by 
@code{array([@var{list-of-names}], @var{dim1}, @var{dim2}, ..., @var{dimk})}.
Undeclared arrays, otherwise known as hashed arrays (because hash
coding is done on the subscripts), are more general than declared
arrays.  The user does not declare their maximum size, and they grow
dynamically by hashing as more elements are assigned values.  The
subscripts of undeclared arrays need not even be numbers.  However,
unless an array is rather sparse, it is probably more efficient to
declare it when possible than to leave it undeclared.  The @code{array}
function can be used to transform an undeclared array into a declared
array.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} arrayapply (array, [sub1, ..., subk])
is like @code{apply} except the first argument is an array.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} arrayinfo (a)
returns a list of information about the array @var{a}.  For
hashed arrays it returns a list of @code{hashed}, the number of subscripts,
and the subscripts of every element which has a value.  For declared
arrays it returns a list of @code{declared}, the number of subscripts, and
the bounds that were given the the @code{array} function when it was called
on @var{a}.  Do @code{example(arrayinfo);} for an example.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} arraymake (name, [i1, i2, ...])
returns @code{@var{name}[@var{i1}, @var{i2}, ...]}.

@end deffn

@defvr {system variable} arrays
default value: @code{[]} - a list of all the arrays that have been allocated,
both declared and undeclared.  Functions which deal with arrays are:
@code{array}, @code{arrayapply}, @code{arrayinfo}, @code{arraymake}, 
@code{fillarray}, @code{listarray}, and @code{rearray}.

@end defvr

@deffn {function} bashindices (expr)
transforms the expression @var{expr} by giving each
summation and product a unique index. This gives @code{changevar} greater
precision when it is working with summations or products.  The form of
the unique index is j<number>. The quantity <number> is determined by
referring to @code{gensumnum}, which can be changed by the user.  For
example, @code{gensumnum:0$} resets it.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} fillarray (array, list-or-array)
fills array from @var{list-or-array}.  If @code{array} is a
floating-point (integer) array then @var{list-or-array} should be
either a list of floating-point (integer) numbers or another
floating-point (integer) array.  If the dimensions of the arrays are
different @var{array} is filled in row-major order.  If there are not enough
elements in @var{list-or-array} the last element is used to fill out the
rest of @var{array}.  If there are too many the remaining ones are thrown
away.  @code{fillarray} returns its first argument.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} getchar (a, i)
returns the @var{i}th character of the quoted string or
atomic name @var{a}.  This function is useful in manipulating the 
@code{labels} list.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} listarray (array)
returns a list of the elements of a declared or
hashed array.  The order is row-major.  Elements which you have not
defined yet will be represented by @code{#####}.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} make_array (type, dim1, dim2, ..., dimn)
- creates an array.  @var{type} may
be @code{'any}, @code{'flonum}, @code{'fixnum}, @code{'hashed} or 
@code{'functional}.  This is similar to
the @code{array} command, except that the created array is a functional array
object.  The advantage of this over @code{array} is that it doesn't have a
name, and once a pointer to it goes away, it will also go away.  For
example if @code{y:make_array(...);} then @code{y} points to an object 
which takes up space, but do @code{y:false}, and @code{y} no longer
points to that object, so the object will get garbage collected.  
Note: the @var{dimi} here are different from the @code{array} command, 
since they go from 0 to i-1, i.e.  a "dimension"
of 10 means you have elements from 0 to 9.

@code{y:make_array('functional,'f,'hashed,1)} - the second argument to
@code{make_array} in this case is the function to call to calculate array
elements, and the rest of the arguments are passed recursively to
@code{make_array} to generate the "memory" for the array function object.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} rearray (array, dim1, ..., dimk)
can be used to change the size or dimensions of an array.  
The new array will be filled with the elements of the old one in
row-major order.  If the old array was too small, 
@code{false}, @code{0.0} or @code{0} will be used to fill the remaining elements,
depending on the type of the array.  The type of the array cannot be
changed.

@end deffn

@deffn {function} remarray (name1, name2, ...)
removes arrays and array associated
functions and frees the storage occupied.  If name is @code{all} then all
arrays are removed.  It may be necessary to use this function if it is
desired to redefine the values in a hashed array.

@end deffn

@defvr {option variable} use_fast_arrays
- if @code{true} then only two types of arrays are recognized.  

1) The art-q array (t in Common Lisp) which may have several dimensions
indexed by integers, and may hold any Lisp or Maxima object as an
entry.  To construct such an array, enter @code{a:make_array(any,3,4);} 
then @code{a} will have as value, an array with twelve slots, and the 
indexing is zero based.

2) The Hash_table array which is the default type of array created if one
does @code{b[x+1]:y^2} (and @code{b} is not already an array, a list, or a
matrix -- if it were one of these an error would be caused since
@code{x+1} would not be a valid subscript for an art-q array, a list or
a matrix). Its indices (also known as keys) may be any object.  
It only takes one key at a time (@code{b[x+1,u]:y} would ignore the @code{u}). 
Referencing is done by @code{b[x+1] ==> y^2}.  Of course the key may be
a list, e.g. @code{b[[x+1,u]]:y} would be valid.  This is incompatible 
with the old Maxima hash arrays, but saves consing.

An advantage of storing the arrays as values of the symbol is that the
usual conventions about local variables of a function apply to arrays as
well.  The Hash_table type also uses less consing and is more efficient
than the old type of Maxima hashar.  To obtain consistent behaviour in
translated and compiled code set @code{translate_fast_arrays} to be
@code{true}.
