Many hands and minds have contributed to Macsyma, in developing
it as a research program, and tuning it for use by others.
We have enjoyed constructing
Macsyma and we hope that you will enjoy using it.
We hope you will consider
contributing your carefully polished and documented
application programs to libraries at your local installation and
other sites.
