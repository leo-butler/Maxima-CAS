Creating a PDF/PS/DVI file from maximabook sources

In order to generate these documents, you will need
to have the following components installed and 
working properly:

Emacs
  http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/
  Included with most Linux distributions

Emaxima
  Included with Maxima.  See other docs for
  how to install and setup Emaxima.

A TeX distribution with pdflatex - tested with teTeX
  http://www.tug.org/teTeX/

breqn
  ftp://ftp.ams.org/pub/tex/
  Install this into an appropriate directory in your texmf directory, then
  run texhash.  On Gentoo Linux, for example, this would be the procedure:
  cp breqn094.tgz /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/
  tar -xvzf breqn094.tgz
  texhash

pdfcolmk.sty 
  http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/oberdiek/pdfcolmk.sty
  Note that some Linux distributions include this, and some don't.  Safe
  bet - put in in a folder with emaxima.sty.
  Install this into an appropriate directory in your texmf directory, then
  run texhash.  On Gentoo Linux, for example, this would be the procedure:
  mkdir /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/emaxima
  cp pdfcolmk.sty /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/emaxima/
  cp emaxima.sty /usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/emaxima/
  texhash

In addition, you may need to increase your pool size in 
your TeX distribution.  This will probably be in a file 
called /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf, or wherever 
texmf.cnf is in your distribution.  Some distributions 
default to large enough values, so only change this if
you are seeing errors about pool sizes.


Available commands.

make pdf

   This makes a basic pdf file.
   
make pdf-final

   This makes a pdf file with thumbnails.  You will need
   thumbpdf working properly for this to work.

make ps

   This makes a postscript file.

make ps4page   

   This uses the a2ps command to create a four page per 
   physical page postscript file.

make dvi
 
   Makes a dvi file.
   
make clean

   Removes all the usual TeX output files to allow for a clean run
