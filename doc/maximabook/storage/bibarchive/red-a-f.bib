                 the particle motion in wiggler and undulator fields by
                 an algebraic mapping routine. The solution is based on
                 a series expansion up to the third order in the two
                 transversal angle coordinates and, as a third
                 variable, the bending radius of the particle orbit.
                 The wiggler and undulator fields are represented by an
                 expansion as suggested by K. Halbach. The report
                 consists of two parts. In the first part we solve the
                 equations of motion by an iteration procedure, which
                 originally was also the first approach. In the second
                 part the solution is based on a Taylor series
                 expansion. Both approaches are equivalent.",

                 fields, as they are typically applied in lattice
