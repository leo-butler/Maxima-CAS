%%%                        At version 1.20 [05-Feb-1996], a search of
%%%                        the OCLC Article1st database resulted in
%%%                        the addition of 88 new references.  At

%%%                        OCLC ERIC, GEOBASE, MEDLINE, PapersFirst,
%%%                        and Proceedings databases, and the Uncover

%%%                        Wolfram Research Web site, produced almost
%%%                        400 new entries.  At version 1.41
%%%                        [05-Jan-1997], a search of the IEEE INSPEC
%%%                        (Jan--Sep 1996) CD-ROM databases produced
%%%                        92 new references, and a search of the Compendex
%%%                        database produced another 41 references.

%%%                        This bibliography is sorted by year, and

%%%                        proceedings entries appear at the end,

  abstract =     "The Mathematica software package is from Wolfram
                 Research Inc. It requires an 80386 machine with at
                 least an extra megabyte of RAM as extended (not
                 expanded) memory. It also requires DOS version 3.0 or
                 higher, and a hard disk with at least 6 megabytes of
                 free space. Mathematica produces all of its graphical
                 output including (3D plots) in PostScript. It has
                 drivers to translate this output into a form suitable
                 for other printers (Hewlett-Packard LaserJet, Epson FX,
                 and Toshiba P3 and compatibles) but a PostScript
                 printer produces the best quality hardcopy. The author
                 concludes that Mathematica is a truly interesting and
                 significant piece of software. It sets a new standard,
                 particularly in graphics and in intelligent symbolic
                 manipulations, in the category of equation processing
                 software. It is capable of reawakening that love of
                 mathematics that nearly all scientists experience early

                 build intuition and visualization skills in students of
                 electromagnetic courses. These solutions are referred
                 to as visual electromagnetics. The idea is to use upper
                 division students in physics to help generate
                 solutions, and in the process teach these students how
                 to write numerical code and graphically display the
                 results. Modules on electromagnetics are being
                 generated using Mathematica to generate the code and
                 graphics and HyperCard to store the graphics in a mode
                 that allows student interaction. Each module will cover
                 an area in electromagnetics, and will consist of
                 several HyperCard stacks. Mathematica, with its
                 powerful mathematics capabilities and multitude of plot
                 types, makes developing the basic code to generate the
                 graphics much easier than in the past. HyperCard has
                 revolutionized retrieval and organization of the
                 generated solutions allowing text, animation, and sound
                 to be coupled in a seamless manner.",

                 symbolic mathematical program called Mathematica is
                 described. By extending its capabilities through a
                 proper representation of knowledge of discrete signals,
                 operators, and transforms, Mathematica can take the
                 forward and inverse z-transforms symbolically and apply
                 the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) as a symbolic
                 summation. In addition to the 150+ common mathematical
                 operators and functions built into Mathematica, the
                 rule-based package defines 23 systems and 8 basic
                 signals. Six of these systems provide the ability to
                 take forward and inverse z-transforms, DFTs, and DTFTs
                 of multidimensional signal processing expressions. More
                 importantly, this package allows the user to manipulate
                 signals (functions or data) and systems (operators) as
                 algebraic expressions. The user can convert symbolic

  abstract =     "Wide distribution of the computer algebra system
                 Mathematica has encouraged numerous programmers,
                 researchers and educators to produce libraries of
                 programs in its special language, for incorporation as
                 'packages' into Mathematica systems. Some authors have
                 found that the Mathematica proprietary computer program
                 has problematical and difficult-to-alter semantics. An
                 initial step in opening up such user-written libraries
                 to re-use is an independent re-implementation of the
                 language via a non-proprietary parser. The author
                 describes a parser written in Common Lisp, a language
                 which is appropriate for three reasons: it is a
                 standard and has wide distribution; it supports
                 numerous useful features including automatic storage
                 allocation and garbage collection, arbitrary-precision
                 integers and tools for lexical scanning of languages;
                 and Lisp is the host language for several algebraic

                 associated with the analysis of plasma instabilities.
                 Specifically, MATHEMATICA techniques were demonstrated
                 for (1) the analytical derivation of linear plasma
                 responses by means of perturbative solutions of partial
                 differential equations (fluid theory); (2) the
                 analytical solution of transcendental dispersion
                 equations (special functions, series expansions,
                 hierarchies of algebraic systems); (3) parametric
                 analysis of dispersion equations by graphical and
                 numerical methods; and (4) the flexible graphical
                 representation of results generated by traditional
                 numerical methods.",

                 technique to the geometrically nonlinear analysis of
                 curved beams is used to demonstrate the potential of
                 symbolic computations in structural mechanics. The
                 hybrid technique is based on successive use of the
                 regular perturbation method and a classical direct
                 variational procedure. The present application is also
                 used to identify a number of problem areas which limit
                 the realization of the full potential of symbolic
                 computations in nonlinear structural mechanics. The
                 tasks which can be efficiently performed by symbolic
                 computations are: (1) generation of algebraic
                 expressions for the perturbation functions; (2)
                 determination of the radius of covergence of the
                 perturbation series; and (3) evaluation of sensitivity
                 derivatives (derivatives of the different response
                 quantities with respect to the geometric and material
                 parameters of the beam). The symbolic computation
                 system Mathematica is used in the present study. A
                 sample Mathematica program is presented for generating
                 the perturbation functions, applying the direct
                 variational procedure, and evaluating the sensitivity

                 features of an interactive document are described, and
                 it is shown why such a document helps make research and
                 learning more efficient. A program called Mathematica
                 is used to illustrate the points made. A review of
                 tools for signal processing and their desirable
                 features is included to provide a background for the
                 discussion.",

                 three products, SENAC, InterCall and IRENA. Each of the
                 three is in the Numerical Algorithms Group (Fortran
                 77). SENAC is a package developed by the Mathematical
                 Software Project at the University of Waikato. SENAC
                 includes a symbolic manipulation interpreter (Sencore),
                 together with high level interfaces to the NAG Fortran
                 Library (Numlink) and NAG Graphics Library (Graflink).
                 The system evolved from an interface, Naglink, between
                 the NAG Library and the symbolic manipulation language
                 Macsyma. The Sensore interpreter is written in Common
                 LISP and belongs to the Macsyma/Maple/Reduce family of
                 languages. It is easy to load user-written files
                 written in Common LISP or in SENAC. InterCall is a
                 Mathematica package that enables its user to
                 interactively call external code, for example from an
                 external numeric library. It allows various default
                 settings to be defined for any arguments that need to
                 be passed to any routine in that code, and initial
                 default settings for all the routines in the IMSL and
                 NAG libraries are included with InterCall in the form
                 of a small defaults-database file. IRENA-an Interface
                 from Reduce to NAG-runs under the Reduce computer
                 algebra system and provides an interactive front end to
                 the NAG Library. It has been designed to make the use
                 of the NAG Library considerably simpler, in a number of
                 ways.",

                 educational tool for courses in linear systems theory.
                 These extensions are in the form of packages and
                 notebooks for the Mathematica environment. The new
                 signal processing packages contain rule bases that
                 symbolically compute convolutions and all the
                 transforms common to signal processing: Fourier,
                 Laplace, z, etc. In order to introduce a student to
                 these concepts and to how they are implemented in
                 Mathematica, four tutorials have been written in
                 Mathematica's notebook format. Notebooks, a form of
                 hypertext, allow students to access material randomly,
                 to discover insights at their own pace, and to evaluate
                 code provided in the examples. Students can also use
                 notebooks to solve homework problems in a
                 self-documenting fashion.",

                 that 30% of all employed physicists and astronomers,

                 1986, approximately 136,000 individuals were working in
                 materials science and engineering. This substantial
                 number underscores the important role materials play in
                 all technologies. Yet when the Division of Materials
                 Research of the National Science Foundation (NSF)
                 requested a panel of experts to assess the needs and
                 opportunities in the education of undergraduates
                 desiring to pursue careers in materials science and
                 engineering, the panel noted that '. . .in contrast to
                 most other science and engineering disciplines, there
                 is no single focal point in any university for
                 undergraduate education in materials, nor is there any

                 Mathematica programs that come with the book. For
                 example, there is a Mathematica program for modeling
                 multiworkload class computer systems with priorities.
                 Another models closed fixed throughput classes. One of
                 the goals of this book is to not only discuss all the
                 major modeling techniques but to provide examples of
                 their use and exercises to allow to reader to try them
                 out as well. Thus we not only tell the reader how an
                 analytic queueing model can be used to model a computer
                 system, but we also give examples of a number of such
                 models and provide some exercises so that the reader

                 engineering problems to systems of linear algebraic
                 equations. It has been already suggested that the
                 inclusion of a symbolic parameter in the corresponding
                 numerical results leads to a generality and a wide
                 applicability of these results. Here we suggest the
                 direct solution of these equations by using the popular
                 computer algebra system MATHEMATICA. Assuming the
                 results expressed in a Taylor-Maclaurin series form
                 with respect to the selected symbolic parameter, the
                 whole problem is reduced to the solution of an
                 appropriate number of systems of purely numerical
                 linear equations. This can be achieved either inside
                 MATHEMATICA or by using efficient external numerical
                 routines. As an application the above modification of
                 the finite element method was used in the classical

                 pulverized coal combustors was developed, and compared
                 to results of rigorous solutions. The spectral
                 absorption coefficient for the gas components was
                 obtained by using the exponential wide-band model.
                 Closed-form approximations of the spectral extinction
                 and absorption coefficients were obtained for
                 pulverized coal, char, fly-ash, and soot, the four
                 types of polydispersed solid particles typically
                 present inside a coal combustor in the pre-and
                 post-flame regions. All particles were assumed to be
                 spherical, having a modified gamma size-distribution
                 function. The overall radiative properties of the
                 gas-particles mixture is then found by adding the gas
                 and particle contributions. The approximations were
                 compared with exact results from the Mie theory, using
                 Mathematica${}^{TM}$. The approximations, which were
                 found to require minimal computational time, typically
                 produce an error of less than about 7\% in the
                 radiative properties of the particles.",

  abstract =     "The autoparametric vibratory system consisting of a
                 primary spring-mass-dashpot system coupled with a
                 damped simple pendulum serves as an useful example of
                 two degree-of-freedom nonlinear systems that exhibit
                 complex dynamic behavior. It exhibits 1:2 internal
                 resonance and amplitude modulated chaos under harmonic
                 forcing conditions. First-order averaging studies of
                 this system using AUTO and KAOS have yielded useful
                 information about the amplitude dynamics of this
                 system. Response curves of the system indicate
                 saturation and the pitchfork bifurcation sets are found
                 to be symmetric. The period-doubling route to chaotic
                 solutions is observed. However questions about the
                 range of the small parameter \$epsilon (a function of
                 the forcing amplitude) for which the solutions are
                 valid cannot be answered by a first-order study. Some
                 observed dynamical behavior, like saturation, may not
                 persist when higher-order nonlinear effects are taken
                 into account. Second-order averaging of the system,
                 using Mathematica (Maeder, 1991; Wolfram, 1991) is
                 undertaken to address these questions. Loss of
                 saturation is observed in the steady-state amplitude
                 responses. The breaking of symmetry in the various
                 bifurcation sets becomes apparent as a consequence of
                 \$epsilon appearing in the averaged equations. The
                 dynamics of the system is found to be very sensitive to
                 damping, with extremely complicated behavior arising
                 for low values of damping. For large \$epsilon
                 second-order averaging predicts additional Pitchfork
                 and Hopf bifurcation points in the single-mode
                 response.",

                 for describing rainfall-runoff relationships. In the
                 framework of discrete-time black-box systems, the
                 assumptions of linearity, stationarity, and causality
                 yield a convolution equation suitable for the machine
                 computation of runoff from rainfall, once the UH is
                 known. An algorithm based on linear programming (LP)
                 produces an estimate of the UH that fulfills, by
                 construction, the physical constraint of nonnegativity.
                 Using the software Mathematica in the
                 functional-programming style to implement this
                 algorithm, leads to a concise and user-friendly
                 computer code. In two single-storm case studies the

                 competitive with those obtained by the O'Donnell

                 peculiar feature of the LP method: the UH estimate can

  abstract =     "To evaluate the transient dynamic deflection response
                 of a structure requires the mass and stiffness
                 distribution of the structure. If these are not
                 available, one can perform static deflection tests of
                 the structure to develop these needed properties. This
                 paper illustrates how concepts studied in undergraduate
                 mechanical design classes can be used to accomplish
                 this task. The structure was a 36 ft fiberglass whip
                 antenna. A theoretical model was derived by treating it
                 as a horizontal cantilevered beam and using
                 Castigliano's Theorem to analyze the deflection
                 response to transverse loadings. This produced a
                 complicated integral expression at every point where
                 deflections were desired. These integrals were
                 evaluated using Mathematica${}^{TM}$ on a Macintosh.
                 Experimental data were collected by loading a
                 horizontally mounted 36 ft whip antenna with several
                 combinations of bean bags. The calculated deflection at
                 the tip of the antenna under gravity loading was 2\%
                 more than measured. The differential between measured
                 and calculated deflection at the tip from the other
                 loadings was less than 4\%. Using a weight density of
                 0.45 lb\slash cu. ft., a weight of 154 lb was generated
                 from the assumed distribution of outside diameters and
                 the wall thicknesses. A total antenna weight of about
                 185 lb was expected. The numerical model is
                 acknowledged to not model the internal structural
                 configuration at the mid-height threaded joint
                 accurately because it is hidden from view. The outside
                 diameters and wall thicknesses from this study of the
                 static response of the antenna will be used to model
                 the antenna during a transient dynamics response

                 transverse shock loading was desired. A theoretical

                 using Mathematica${}^{TM}$ on a Macintosh. This study
                 is reported in a separate paper. The outside diameters
                 and wall thicknesses developed in the static response
                 study were used to model the antenna during a transient
                 dynamic response study using MSC\slash NASTRAN. All
                 models used SOLN 109, the linear, transient dynamics
                 procedure. This study concluded that the suggested
                 modeling approach is suitable for the static and
                 dynamic response analysis of a 36 ft fiberglass whip
                 antenna to an explosion equivalent to a 4 kiloton blast
                 yielding a peak overpressure of 7 psi. The Basic model
                 suggests a linear finite element model is within 10\%
                 of the observed maximum deflection of about 16 feet.
                 Low-to-midrange stresses are expected at this
                 deformation. It is recommended that additional
                 refinements in parameters which affect the stiffness
                 distribution be made in the model. Each refinement is
                 expected to narrow the gap between the calculated and
                 the experimental response. It is further recommended
                 that a nonlinear analysis be performed using the
                 resulting refined model to add credibility to the use
                 of such models, especially as blast yields and\slash or

  abstract =     "Many different computer algebra systems are regularly
                 used to help students learn topics in calculus, matrix
                 algebra, and physics. They empower students to
                 investigate fundamental relationships expressed as
                 formulas through numerical evaluation and graphical
                 displays. These systems can also carry out much of the
                 tedious algebraic manipulation necessary in solving
                 basic engineering and applied science problems. Most
                 provide a programming language, so new functions can be
                 added to solve more advanced problems. One computer
                 algebra system, Mathematica supports a sophisticated
                 Notebook user interface, which is useful for writing
                 tutorials. Because of this interface, we have chosen
                 Mathematica to assist students in learning linear
                 systems theory. Students interact with Mathematica at
                 two different levels. The lower level is a collection
                 of Mathematica routines known as the signal processing
                 packages (SPP). These packages implement symbolic
                 operations such as convolution and linear transforms
                 and graphical operations such as pole-zero diagrams and
                 frequency response plots. The higher level of
                 interaction is with a set of tutorial Notebooks on
                 topics such as convolution and the z-transform. The
                 complete system will eventually support the theoretical
                 aspects of a signals and systems curriculum from
                 introductory courses through first-year graduate
                 courses.",

                 the Womersley calculation can now be performed without
                 tedium. Since the analysis is suitable for an arbitrary
                 periodic waveform, the calculation of the solution for
                 a range of physiologic waveforms can provide important
                 physical insight as to the fluid mechanics of unsteady
                 flows. This article outlines a computer program which
                 can be implemented by a graduate student as a homework
                 assignment. The program can be used to perform a series
                 of computer experiments to compare the effects of
                 different waveform shapes on the detailed velocity
                 profiles for unsteady flow. As an extension of the
                 analysis, the pulsatile centerline velocity and wall
                 shear rates can be calculated. Similarly, one can use
                 any one of the time-dependent variables of flow,
                 pressure gradient, wall shear, or centerline velocity
                 to calculate the other three. As a byproduct, the
                 student gains valuable experience with the use of
                 numerical solutions to analytical equations.",

                 The area of fracture mechanics and, more explicitly,
                 the case of simple straight cracks was chosen as the
                 vehicle for the illustration of both these approaches

                 trace operations on strings of \$gamma@-algebra

  abstract =     "Formal Laurent-Puisieux series (LPS) are important in
                 calculus and complex analysis. In some computer algebra
                 systems (CASs) it is possible to define an LPS by
                 direct or recursive definition of its coefficients.
                 Since some operations cannot be directly supported
                 within the LPS domain, some systems generally convert
                 LPS to finite truncated LPS for operations such as
                 addition, multiplication, division, inversion and
                 formal substitution. This results in a substantial loss
                 of information. Since a goal of computer algebra is to
                 work with formal objects and preserve such symbolic
                 information, CAS should be able to use LPS when
                 possible. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
                 formal power series with positive radius of convergence
                 and corresponding analytic functions. It should be
                 possible to automate conversion between these forms.
                 Among CASs only MACSYMA provides a procedure power
                 series to calculate LPS from analytic expressions in
                 certain special cases, but this is rather limited. W.
                 Koepf (1992) gave an algorithmic approach for computing
                 an LPS for a very rich family of functions. It covers
                 e.g. a high percentage of the power series that are
                 listed in the special series dictionary (E. R. Hansen,
                 1975). the algorithm has been implemented by W. Koepf
                 and A. Rennoch in the CAS Mathematica (1991). The
                 author presents some example results of the Mathematica
                 implementation which gives insight in the underlying
                 algorithmic procedure. (7 Refs.)",

                 design for the automatic use of a computer algebra
                 system (CAS). Such an agent must take a task

                 achieving the task while also producing a plan for the
                 CAS. In particular, I use the Soar architecture to
                 build an agent for using Mathematica, guided by a study
                 of protocols of human users of Mathematica. The general
                 design principles for mediating agents suggested by the
                 particular agent for Mathematica include a
                 blackboard-style control structure using a production

                 MIMO\slash QFT CAD package to handle the design of
                 discrete in addition to analog robust control systems
                 for MIMO uncertain plants. Version 2 of the CAD package
                 is capable of carrying an analog or discrete design
                 problem from problem setup through the design process
                 to a frequency domain analysis of the compensated MIMO
                 system. For analog control problems, the design process
                 is performed in the s-plane, while for the discrete
                 control problems the plants are discretized and the
                 design process is performed in the w'-plane. The
                 package automates the selection of the weighting
                 matrix; descretization of the plants; formation of the
                 square effective plants; the polynomial matrix inverse
                 required to form the equivalent plants; generation of
                 templates; selection of a nominal plant; generation of
                 stability, tracking, disturbance, gamma, and composite
                 bounds; loop shaping; design of the prefilter elements;
                 frequency-domain analysis of the completed design; and
                 the export of the completed design to MATRIXx or MATLAB
                 for time-domain simulation. Disturbance allocation is
                 automatically performed while generating the tracking
                 bounds. The package allows gain scheduling to be used
                 in the weighting matrix. The improved method may be
                 applied for the general case of an m\$MUL@m effective
                 plant. The package is implemented using Mathematica for
                 use on the Sun Workstations.",

                 issue in recent years and has been addressed
                 extensively by several national organizations. This
                 paper discusses a summer Institute in discrete
                 mathematics for high school teachers. A detailed
                 outline is presented. Our survey indicated the
                 participants of the Institute had `none' to `vague'
                 prior exposure to 71\% of the discrete mathematics
                 topics presented in the course. The significant
                 difference between this Institute and possibly others
                 is the use of Mathematica as an integral part of the
                 Institute. Mathematica provides an additional
                 reinforcement of the material presented, especially in
                 the area of graph theory and combinatorics. Mathematica
                 can be a powerful motivating force and problem solving
                 tool for high school students in their development of
                 mathematical skills. We are encouraged by the success
                 of this Institute in providing a needed service in our
                 community. We hope the work reported in this paper will

                 process. In this, the `what-if' game is a very useful
                 tactic in the search for unexpected solutions in
                 complex design spaces, made all the more effective by
                 the availability of automated interpreters. These are
                 needed to perform the tedious re-calculation of the
                 model each time a change is made to a small part. In
                 the financial world, the interpreter generally takes
                 the form of the spread-sheet, of which Quattro is a
                 fine example; in mathematics it takes the form of
                 packages such as Mathematica. Neither of these is
                 ideally tailored for engineering design, and so Abotec
                 was developed when the author had need of such a tool.
                 There are four main characteristics which fit Abotec
                 for its purpose: it works with floating-point numbers
                 throughout; it uses a richer than normal set of
                 arithmetic operators and functions; it uses mnemonic
                 labelling throughout; and, most importantly it treats
                 all variables as having an upper and lower bound.",

  abstract =     "In this paper, a new scheme of stochastic averaging
                 using elliptic functions is presented that approximates
                 nonlinear dynamical systems with strong cubic
                 nonlinearities in the presence of noise by a set of Ito
                 differential equations. This is an extension of some
                 recent results presented in deterministic dynamical
                 systems. The second order nonlinear differential
                 equation that is examined in this work can be expressed
                 as x+ c${}_1$x+ c${}_3$x${}^3$+\$epsilon@f(x,x)
                 +\$epsilon${}^{1/2}$g(x,x,\$xi@(t)) $=$ 0, where
                 c${}_1$ and c${}_3$ are given constants, \$xi@(t) is
                 stationary stochastic process with zero mean and
                 \$epsilon\$VLST@1 is a small parameter. This method
                 involves the laborious manipulation of Jacobian
                 elliptic functions such as cn, dn and sn rather than
                 the usual trigonometric functions. The use of a
                 symbolic language such as Mathematica reduces the
                 computational effort and allows us to express the
                 results in a convenient form. The resulting equations
                 are Markov approximations of amplitude and phase
                 involving integrals of elliptic functions. Finally,
                 this method was applied to study some standard second
                 order systems.",

  abstract =     "Machine element analysis has a goal of describing
                 function and other aspects of machine elements in a
                 theoretical form. This paper shows how ideas from
                 object-oriented modelling can be applied to machine
                 element analysis. The models thus obtained are both
                 easier to understand, better structured, and allow a
                 higher degree of re-use than conventional models. An
                 object-oriented model description is natural and
                 suitable for machine element analysis. As a realistic
                 example an equational model of rolling bearings is
                 presented. The structure of the model is general, and
                 applies to many types of rolling bearings. The model
                 and one solution require approximately 200 + 200
                 equations. The model is extensible, e.g. simple
                 submodels of detailed properties can be made more
                 complex without altering the overall structure. The
                 example model has been implemented in a language of our
                 own design, ObjectMath (Object-oriented Mathematical
                 language for scientific computing). Using ObjectMath,
                 it is possible to model classes of equation objects, to
                 support multiple and single inheritance of equations,
                 to support composition of equations, and to solve
                 systems of equations. Algebraic transformations can
                 conveniently be done since ObjectMath models are
                 translated into the Mathematica computer algebra
                 language. When necessary, equations can be transformed
                 to C++ code for efficient numerical solution. The
                 re-use of equations through inheritance reduced the
                 size of the model by a factor of two, compared to a
                 direct representation of the model in the Mathematica
                 computer algebra language.",

                 fully deployed. In order to achieve this behavior, a
                 detailed geometric design is required which consists of
                 deriving and solving sets of highly nonlinear geometric
                 and trigonometric equations. The symbolic manipulation

                 usually reduces to solving a set of simultaneous
                 polynomial equations. Mathematica software offers a
                 convenient method for doing this. Using buffering of
                 Ca2+ by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl
                 ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) as an example,
                 we provide a Mathematica script to estimate the
                 apparent association constant. A second example shows
                 how to calculate free ion concentrations when two
                 ligands (Ca2+ and Mg2+) compete for one chelator
                 (EGTA). Finally, the concentrations of all species are
                 determined in a complex mixture containing Ca2+, EGTA,
                 and calmodulin, a protein with four Ca(2+)-binding

                 several different tokamaks has been stored in the
                 Magnetic Fusion Energy Database (MFEDB). Although there
                 are several tools currently available, such as the
                 Mathematica Database Interface (MDI) and a Mosaic
                 server, for retrieving and graphing these datasets,
                 they are limited in their ability to easily perform
                 more sophisticated tasks such as applying complex
                 constraints to the data and performing elaborate
                 statistical analysis such as nonlinear multivariate
                 regression. In order to facilitate these tasks, two new
                 Mathematic packages have been developed. The first
                 package, which relies heavily on MDI, allows the user
                 to select data sets from the MFEDB and write them to a
                 local file in a tabular form. The second package takes
                 advantage of several of the Standard Mathematica
                 Packages and a package developed by Maeder (1993) which
                 provides standard database functionality. The second
                 package reads in the table of data written by the first
                 and creates a table or a relation in database
                 terminology. This relation can now be restricted in
                 both dimensions using the projection operation to
                 narrow the relation or the selection operation to
                 shorten the relation. Once the dataset has been
                 appropriately restricted, each column may be treated as
                 a single variable which can be manipulated with any
                 Mathematica operator.",

  abstract =     "Chaos is ubiquitous in our everyday life and even a
                 simple system may manifest chaotic behaviors. Chaos has
                 been a challenge to the methodology of qualitative
                 reasoning as well as classic science and engineering,
                 due to unpredictability and complexity of behavior. In
                 this paper, I claim that associating continuous domain
                 with symbolic representation, a basic principle of
                 qualitative reasoning, is vital for automating analysis
                 of chaos, as long as it is properly formalized. As an
                 empirical support to this claim, I present a computer
                 program called PSX3 that can semi-automatically explore
                 for chaotic behavior of a given system of piecewise
                 linear ordinary differential equations with three
                 unknown functions. The power of PSX3 originates from an
                 ability of reasoning about smooth surfaces that
                 implicitly exist in the phase space. PSX3 is
                 implemented using Common Lisp and
                 Mathematica${}^{TM}$.",

                 the Coordinated Science Laboratory at the University of
                 IL at Urbana-Champaign, is a collection of function
                 definitions for the Mathematica symbolic mathematics
                 program. Primarily, Robotica has the ability to
                 compute, symbolically or numerically, the kinematic and
                 dynamic equations of arbitrary robot systems using
                 standard Denevit-Hartenburg kinematic convention. It
                 also has the ability to visualize these arbitrary
                 manipulators using the X-Windows graphical interface to
                 the Mathematica graphics routines. Still in use at the
                 Air Force Institute of Technology, Robotica has been
                 successful in illustrating kinematics and dynamics
                 concepts in fundamental robotics. Aside from helping
                 students visualize those concepts, it also relieves
                 them of the drudgery inherent in complicated dynamics
                 calculations. Even with those obvious assets,
                 Robotica's development could still be further enhanced
                 by taking advantage of Mathematica's ability to solve
                 multivariable problems and create a general trajectory
                 generation function. The software can also possibly
                 evaluate kinematic singularities in both joint and
                 Cartesian spaces.",

                 in structural acoustics there has been little activity
                 clarifying the basic elements which underlie his
                 theory. Soize's papers are not easy reading due to the
                 high level of mathematical formalism. In addition Soize
                 simultaneously bases this fuzzy structure theory on two
                 components: (1) a model for one Degree Of Freedom (DOF)
                 fuzzy oscillators, and (2) a medium frequency solution
                 method developed previously. It is unclear as to the
                 role of the two components, although others have
                 already undertaken a study of the medium frequency
                 method by itself. In the present paper a fundamental
                 analysis of the first component. the one-DOF fuzzy
                 oscillators, is undertaken. The symbolic manipulation
                 program Mathematica is utilized to gain insight into
                 this component of Soize's fuzzy theory. The resulting
                 Mathematica simulations are easy to use and interpret.
                 and they provide valuable insight into the parameters
                 composing Soize's fuzzy oscillators. It is determined
                 that in many cases of structural acoustics, where there
                 is small damping and a medium to high modal density,
                 the fuzzy mass primarily determines what effect a
                 discrete fuzzy oscillator will have as an attachment.",

                 how complex systems will operate and perform, without
                 actually having to build a physical model to test. It
                 is best to write the simulator in a higher level
                 programming language, in our case we use Mathematica
                 and are able to obtain fast results with excellent
                 graphing capabilities. The goal of our research is to
                 find a method for obtaining an estimate of the average
                 access delay for advanced token ring based networks
                 such as FDDI (fiber distributed data interface) or FFOL
                 (FDDI follow on LAN). We have developed a method that
                 will generate exact results at low to medium loaded
                 networks. As the load level increases, the error rate
                 also increases, this however is monitored and can be
                 used as a confidence measure for the results obtained.
                 A symmetric multimedia environment is used as the
                 model, with bimodal traffic consisting of short data
                 packets and longer video packets. The method we
                 developed to calculate the estimated average access
                 time under a specific network configuration as a
                 function of varied offered load. A full listing of the

                 conditions are satisfied automatically and the related
                 functional equation of Muskhelishvili is approximately
                 solved by selection of the collocation points outside
                 the elastic medium. This ensures the approximate
                 solution of the biharmonic equation of plane
                 elasticity. This approach is completely different from
                 boundary element and finite element methods, since the
                 main attempt is to satisfy the analyticity of the
                 complex potentials (almost equivalently, the biharmonic
                 equation) and not the boundary conditions or both of
                 these. The modern and powerful computer algebra system
                 Mathematica was selected as an appropriate programming
                 language for the related computer procedure, which is
                 also given. Symbolic parameters can also be used in the

                 and semi-numerical results in a special application

                 observer-based fault detection schemes for uncertain
                 systems we suggest a robust fault detection technique
                 for an U-Tube steam generator. One major problem in
                 modelling steam generators is the proper identification
                 of the heat transfer coefficients which in reality are
                 distributed parameters depending on the temperature-
                 and pressure-conditions inside the steam generator. If
                 no counter measures were taken, those improperly
                 identified model parameters would corrupt the residuals
                 generated by a fault detection observer. The problem of
                 designing fault detection observers which are robust to
                 unknown parameters can be reduced to a system of
                 partial differential equations. We propose a general
                 method to calculate approximate solutions for first
                 order partial differential equations based on the
                 computer software Mathematica and apply it in turn to

                 are most easily described at a very high level using
                 computer algebra tools to describe the requisite
                 mathematical operations over a finite field. We
                 illustrate that the Mathematica programming language
                 provides an appropriate set of constructs for modeling
                 the various linear algebraic algorithms that are
                 required to implement the encoding and decoding steps.
                 This level of description corresponds to a form of
                 high-level system modeling. The design and simulation
                 process for a particular Reed-Solomon code is given as

                 means to parallelize programs, written in a serial
                 programming model, for efficient execution on
                 distributed-memory multicomputers. A previous
                 implementation of the compiler based on the PTD
                 representation allowed symbolic array sizes, affine
                 loop bounds and array subscripts, and variable number
                 of processors, provided that arrays were single-or
                 multi-dimensionally block distributed. The techniques
                 presented here extend the compiler to also accept
                 multi-dimensional cyclic and block-cyclic distributions
                 within a uniform symbolic framework. These extensions
                 demand more sophisticated symbolic manipulation
                 capabilities. A novel aspect of our approach is to meet
                 this demand by interfacing PARADIGM with a powerful
                 off-the-shelf symbolic package, Mathematica. This paper
                 describes some of the Mathematica routines that
                 performs various transformations, shows how they are
                 invoked and used by the compiler to overcome the new
                 challenges, and presents experimental results for code
                 involving cyclic and block-cyclic arrays as evidence of
                 the feasibility of the approach.",

                 they just didn't need to physically come to class. Now
                 the Calculus \& Mathematica course is teaching high
                 school seniors through out the state, and even
                 attracting them to enroll in the sponsoring university
                 after graduation. The professor who helped develop the
                 course discusses its content, its structure and the
                 various technologies used to deliver and manage it.

                 determination of the shear centre and the evaluation of
                 the overall state of stress in multicell thin-walled
                 sections subject to axial force, bending moment,
                 shearing force and torque. Graph theory is shown to be
                 the rationale to establish a topological model of the
                 section which is preliminary to a computer
                 implementation of the shear stress analysis.
                 Specifically, we exploit the main features of the
                 Depth-First-Search graph algorithm in order to
                 automatically determine a number of independent
                 circuits equal to the degree of connection m of the
                 section. The algorithm also localize the m slits which
                 make the section open, a preliminary step for the
                 analysis of multicell sections subject to a shearing
                 force. Further, the evaluation of the first elastic
                 area moment at any point of the open section is
                 addressed by means of the Open-Section-Cut algorithm
                 elaborated in this paper. The outlined procedure
                 entails a considerable simplification of the analysis,
                 since the geometrical data which need to be assigned
                 are only the strictly necessary ones, namely the
                 coordinates of the vertices, the branches connecting
                 them and their thickness. A numerical example, carried
                 out for a ship's hull by means of a computer program
                 written in Mathematica, shows the effectiveness of the
                 proposed approach.",

                 kinematic features of the generating system are
                 introduced. The synthesis of the relations among the
                 parameters of the generating process is performed by
                 the following operations: (1) the form-shaping (FS)
                 function (i.e. position vector-function of the machine
                 tool) is synthesized; (2) the redundant kinematic
                 parameters within the FS function are elucidated and
                 linked through analysis of the rank of the gradient of
                 the FS function; (3) an enveloping order of the
                 generation process is calculated through analysis of
                 the number of degrees of freedom; and (4), depending on
                 the enveloping order and the dimensionality of the set
                 of generating points of the cutting tool, six standard
                 representations of enveloping equations are formed. The
                 intermediate analytical procedures are automated using
                 the `Mathematica' system. The setup of the machine tool
                 for grinding a helical surface of the K-worm is
                 computed as a real-world application.",

                 gives better results than the corresponding Rayleigh
                 quotient, but its implementation is not
                 straightforward, at least for non-uniform redundant
                 beams. Quite recently a modified approach has been
                 proposed, in which the main difficulty is overcome, and
                 some preliminary results were given for a tapered beam.
                 In this paper an iterative procedure is suggested,
                 which leads to closer approximations to the true
                 results, and to dramatic improvements in the Rayleigh
                 quotient performances. Consequently, narrow lower-upper
                 bounds can be deduced. Clamped beams and
                 clamped-supported beams with rectangular cross-sections
                 and linearly varying height are thoroughly
                 investigated, providing some interesting comparisons
                 with the results given in [1]. The exact differential
                 equations have been solved for this particular
                 cross-section variation law, in terms of Bessel
                 functions, so that exact critical loads and free
                 frequencies can be used to illustrate the performance
                 of the proposed approach. A small program was written,
                 by using the symbolic package Mathematica, so that a
                 large sample of numerical examples could be offered.",

                 Schr{\"o}dinger equation that includes losses and
                 third-order dispersion. A sequence of programs has been
                 developed to assist the student to explore in depth
                 several features of the soliton's formation,
                 propagation, and collision. These numerical routines
                 were implemented for the use with MATHEMATICA and the

  abstract =     "This paper presents a PC based alternative procedure
                 for determining the water saturations within the hot
                 water zone of a thermal project for use in analytical
                 oil recovery calculations. Conventional analytical
                 calculation of oil recovery under steam and hot water
                 injection requires the tracking of the movements of the
                 saturations advancing within the variable-temperature
                 hot-water zone. This involves an adaptation of the
                 Buckley-Leverett theory to this variable temperature
                 zone after dividing it into a number of constant
                 temperature or isothermal zones. If the number exceeds
                 two, the calculation can become very tedious unless
                 done with a computer program. FORTRAN programs have
                 generally been used but they are not as intuitive or
                 easy to use as modern PC based programming tools such
                 as Mathematica. In this paper, Mathematica was used
                 because it is relatively easy to program, easy to use,
                 and is fast and robust. Unfortunately, depending on the
                 number of isothermal zones, the time step size and the
                 time at which the recovery calculation is desired, the
                 tracking of saturations can tax the capabilities of
                 even the most modern PCs. Therefore, an alternative
                 method is introduced that eliminates the need for
                 saturation tracking. This method calculates the
                 instantaneous saturations within each isothermal zone
                 at the time of interest. Oil recovery results by this
                 method were found to be comparable to those by the
                 saturation tracking method with considerable saving in
                 computation time. Two examples are presented to
                 demonstrate the utility of the method.",

  abstract =     "The presence of twisted helical flow patterns in the
                 cardiac cavities during ventricular filling and
                 ejection was supposed. This work was intended in order
                 to show that the intraventricular trabeculation plays
                 the determining role in such a flow formation and to
                 find some analytical approaches for its analysis. The
                 morphometric study of human left-ventricular and aortic
                 corrosion casts and dynamic measurement of the aorta by
                 MRI-technique were performed. The data were analysed by
                 means of the `Mathematica' program. Two groups of
                 trabecules were identified that refer to the inlet and
                 outlet of the ventricular blood flow. The first group
                 consists of trabecules of the free left-ventricular
                 wall. The second group consists of long trabecules
                 going along the anterior left-ventricular wall and
                 intracavital lines of the papillary muscles. Both are
                 twisted clockwise and converge in the flow direction.
                 Each group of trabecules is oriented towards the mitral
                 or aortic valve orifices, correspondingly. It was
                 concluded that the helical trabecular organization acts
                 as flow directing paddles that change their mutual
                 orientation during the cardiac cycle evolution. The
                 reorientation of the flow takes place due to sequential
                 contraction of the ventricular structures. The
                 formalization of trabecular orientation will allow one
                 to calculate improved models of implantable substitutes
                 and auxiliary devices for cardio-vascular surgery.",

                 theory, which accounts for effects of shear deformation
                 and rotary inertia, was employed. A closed-form
                 solution is presented, which was used to calculate
                 frequencies with the aid of a symbolic computation
                 software (Mathematica). To illustrate the effects of
                 shear deformation, the results were compared to those
                 obtained through the classical plate theory. The study
                 was conducted for five different combinations of
                 boundary conditions. The effects of the location of the
                 intermediate support on the natural frequencies and on
                 the validity of the classical theory assumptions were
                 investigated, as well as the effects of transverse
                 shear rigidity and plate thickness. The results show
                 that when the ring support is close to an edge support
                 the fundamental natural frequency of an isotropic plate
                 may be as low as about 65\% of the classical value. For
                 higher modes the shear effect is even larger and the

  abstract =     "In this article, we describe an interactive,
                 MATLAB-based, platform-independent, educational tool
                 which integrates numerical methods for solving problems
                 ranging from linear algebraic systems to partial
                 differential systems with a graphical user interface.
                 For modularity, the tool is divided into three blocks:
                 (1) a collection of numerical methods, which
                 constitutes the core of the package; (2) a series of
                 examples, problems, and figures, which contributes to
                 the understanding of the applicability of the numerical
                 techniques implemented in the package; and (3) a
                 graphics user interface, which integrates the methods
                 and examples into MATLAB's graphical environment. The
                 numerical methods range in complexity from elementary
                 applications to more complex examples representative of
                 engineering problems of interest. A help facility
                 assists the user with the program features. Sample
                 problems are presented to demonstrate the utility of
                 the program as an educational tool and as a vehicle for
                 introducing students to new numerical concepts and
                 their graphical visualization.",
