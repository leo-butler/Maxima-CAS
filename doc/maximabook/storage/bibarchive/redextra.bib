  abstract =     "The quadtrees matrix representation has been recently
                 proposed as an alternative to the conventional linear
                 storage of matrices. If all elements of a matrix are
                 zero, then the matrix is represented by an empty tree;
                 otherwise it is represented by a tree consisting of
                 four subtrees, each representing, recursively, a
                 quadrant of the matrix. Using four-way block
                 decomposition, algorithms on quadtrees accelerate on
                 blocks entirely of zeros, and thereby offer improved
                 performance on sparse matrices. The paper reports the
                 results of experiments done with a quadtree matrix
                 package implemented in REDUCE to compare the
                 performance of quadtree representation with REDUCE's
                 built-in sequential representation of matrices. Tests
                 on addition, multiplication, and inversion of dense,
                 triangular, tridiagonal, and diagonal matrices (both
                 symbolic and numeric) of sizes up to 100*100 show that
                 the quadtree algorithms perform well in a broad range
                 of circumstances, sometimes running orders of magnitude
                 faster than their sequential counterparts.",

                 conditions for polynomial-nonlinear evolution equations
                 and systems in one-spatial and one-temporal dimensions.
                 These conditions follow from the existence of higher
                 infinitesimal symmetries and conservation law
                 densities. We briefly consider the mathematical
                 background of the symmetry approach to the problem of
                 integrability. In the description of our algorithms and
                 their implementation in REDUCE we present in particular
                 the basic algorithm for reversing the operator of the
                 total derivative with respect to the spatial variable.
                 One of the most interesting application of the present
                 program is the problem of classification when the
                 complete list of integrable equations from a given
                 multiparametric family is needed. In this case the
                 program generates necessary integrability conditions in
                 form of a system of nonlinear algebraic equations in
                 the parameters present in the initial equations. In
                 spite of their often complicated structure, there are
                 systems for which the solution can be found in exact
                 form by applying the technique of Groebner basis. We

                 the finite difference method is applied. The computer

                 language FORTRAN are used in the methodology presented,
                 its main aim being to speed up the process of preparing
                 numerical programs for solving PDES. Quite often,
                 especially for complicated systems, this process is a
                 tedious and time consuming task. In the process several
                 stages can be found in which computer algebra can be
                 used for performing routine analytical calculations,
                 namely: transformation of differential equations into

  abstract =     "The presentation re-expresses the 1976 Risch method in
                 terms of rewrite rules, and thus exposes the major
                 problem it suffers from as a manifestation of the fact
                 that in certain circumstances the set of rewrites
                 generated is not confluent. This difficulty is then
                 attacked using a critical-pair/completion (CPC)
                 approach. For very many integrands it is then easy to
                 see that the initial set of rewrites used in the early
                 implementations do not need any extension, and this
                 fact explains the high level of competence of the
                 programs involved despite their shaky theoretical
                 foundations. For a further large collection of problems
                 even a simple CPC scheme converges rapidly; when the
                 techniques are applied to the REDUCE integration test
                 suite in all applicable cases a short computation
                 succeeds in completing the set of rewrites and hence
                 gives a secure basis for testing for integrability.
                 This paper describes the implementation of the CPC
                 process and discusses current limitations to and
                 possible future extended applications of it.",

                 a Hensel lifting of a modular Gr{\"o}bner basis over
                 lucky primes to a rational one. They have to solve a
                 linear system with modular polynomial entries that
                 requires another (modular) Gr{\"o}ner basis
                 computation. After an extension of luckiness to
                 arbitrary (commutative noetherian) base rings we show
                 in this paper that for a homogeneous polynomial ideal I
                 one lift not only its Gr{\"o}bner basis but also a
                 homogeneous basis of its syzygy module. The same result
                 holds for arbitrary ideals and liftings from Z/p to Q.
                 Moreover the same lifting can be obtained from a true
                 Gro{\"o}bner trace by linear algebra over Q only.
                 Parallel modular techniques allow to find such a true
                 Gro{\"o}bner and a lucky prime with high probability.
                 All these results generalize in an obvious way to
                 homogeneous modules generated by the rows of matrices
                 with polynomial entries. Since luckiness can be
                 weakened to a condition that transfers from I to higher
                 syzygy modules the lifting theorem generalizes to a

  abstract =     "The paper presents the features of a program package,
                 Polymech-symbol, helping to solve some laborious
                 mechanical problems. The package was written by means
                 of the REDUCE system and contains several algorithms in
                 a form of REDUCE procedures. The computer algebra
                 methods may be successfully used for solving the
                 problems of navigation and defining the trajectory of
                 satellite mass centre motion. The preliminary
                 analytical research provides the effective algorithm
                 for on-board solving the problem of prediction. To
                 assure necessary accuracy, we need to construct several
                 higher approximations. Such sophisticated problems can
                 be solved only with the help of symbolic computations
                 that deal with the processing of cumbersome analytical
                 expressions. For effective analytical investigation of
                 such kinds of problems, the choice of parameters which
                 describe the perturbed orbital motion is critical. In
                 addition to the natural requirements of the calculation
                 process efficiency and the absence of singularities in
                 equations of motion, it is useful to have a unified
                 mathematical description for the angular motion and for
                 the motion of the mass centre.",

  abstract =     "Many numerical methods used in power system simulation
                 require the computation of Jacobian matrices. This
                 being particularly true for implicit integration
                 algorithms, and not for explicit ones. These
                 computations often take a significant proportion of the
                 overall CPU time. This paper presents an application of
                 the automatic differentiation method which results in
                 large savings in the computation of Jacobian matrices.
                 An original application of this method is in a software
                 which simulates power systems dynamics. As the program
                 enables the users to introduce their own models,
                 automatic differentiation becomes particularly
                 efficient. In comparison with numerical
                 differentiation, it leads to a saving of 80\% of the
                 time required for the computation of the Jacobian
                 matrices and up to 28\% of the total CPU time.
                 Automatic differentiation is a very efficient method
                 which should be valuable to other power system
                 software, in particular those which offer users the
                 possibility of defining their own models.",

                 usually reduces to solving a set of simultaneous
                 polynomial equations. Mathematica software offers a
                 convenient method for doing this. Using buffering of
                 Ca2+ by ethylene glycol bis(beta-aminoethyl
                 ether)-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA) as an example,
                 we provide a Mathematica script to estimate the
                 apparent association constant. A second example shows
                 how to calculate free ion concentrations when two
                 ligands (Ca2+ and Mg2+) compete for one chelator
                 (EGTA). Finally, the concentrations of all species are
                 determined in a complex mixture containing Ca2+, EGTA,
                 and calmodulin, a protein with four Ca(2+)-binding
                 sites. Modifying the examples presented should allow
                 analysis of most practical buffering problems.",
