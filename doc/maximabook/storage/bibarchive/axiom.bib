                 X/sub n/). If so, the algorithm produces a polynomial P
                 of m variables where g=P(f/sub 1/,\ldots{}, f/sub m/).
                 Say omega:B to k(X/sub 1/,\ldots{}, X/sub n/) is a

                 composite omega lambda is the identity map. In
                 particular, the algorithm computes the inverse of

                 incorporate a type checking system based on the

                 checking. A major factor constraining the

                 0-dimensional polynomial ideals. It is based on a
                 relation between Gr{\"o}bner bases w.r.t. a
                 lexicographical ordering and elimination ideals. The
                 algorithms discussed in this paper are implemented in

                 which represent infinite power series. The technique

                 natural but computationally inefficient way and
                 transforms it to an equivalent, efficient form. This is
                 achieved by using a fixed point operator on the delayed

                 describes this fixed point method and the class of
                 problems to which it is applicable. It has been used in

                 propagated. The solution adopted is based largely on
                 the Seidenberg conditions (F) and (P), but there are
                 several additional points that have to be borne in mind
                 to produce reasonably efficient algorithms in the
                 required generality. The consequence of the algorithms
                 and interfaces presented is that Scratchpad can
                 factorize in any extension of the integers or finite
                 fields by any combination of polynomial, fraction and
                 algebraic extensions: a capability far more general

                 scratchpad' and it certainly lives up to its billing.
                 It is an extremely user-friendly collection of
                 numerical routines that eliminates the drudgery of
                 solving many of the types of problems encountered by
                 undergraduate ChE's (and engineers in general). MathCAD
                 is available for both the Macintosh and IBM PC
                 compatibles. The PC version is available as a
                 full-functioned student version for around US\$40 (less
                 than many textbooks). Theorist is a symbolic
                 mathematical package for the Macintosh. Many
                 interesting and instructive things can be done with it
                 in the ChE curriculum. One of its many attractive
                 features includes the ability to generate high quality
                 three dimensional plots that can be very instructive in

                 aims at returning exact solutions to given problems.
                 One consequence is that the shape of the solutions may,
                 at first, look somewhat surprising. The authors present
                 two examples of problem solving using computer algebra,
                 with emphasis on the shape of the solutions. The first
                 example is the resolution of linear differential
                 equations with polynomial coefficients, and the second
                 one is the resolution of polynomial equations in one
                 variable. In the first example the solution may look
                 useless since it makes use of divergent series, and in
                 the second example the solution may look rather
                 awkward. But in both examples it is shown that these
                 solutions are in the right shape for a lot of
                 applications, including numerical ones. It is also
                 shown that some features of the computer algebra system

                 of a square matrix with coefficients in a field K using
                 the computer algebra system Axiom. This system presents
                 the advantage of allowing generic programming. That is
                 to say, the algorithm can first be implemented for
                 matrices with rational coefficients and then
                 generalized to matrices with coefficients in any field.
                 Therefore the author presents the general method which
                 is essentially based on the use of the Frobenius form
                 of a matrix in order to compute its Jordan form; and

                 the algorithm froben which computes the Frobenius form
                 of a matrix, and on the other she examines in some

  abstract =     "Scratchpad (Griesmer and Jenks, 1971) was a computer
                 algebra system that had one principal representation
                 for mathematical formulae based on expression trees.
                 Its user interface design was based on a
                 pattern-matching paradigm with infinite rewrite rule
                 semantics, providing what we believe to be the most
                 natural paradigm for interactive symbolic problem
                 solving. Like M and M, however, user programs were
                 interpreted, often resulting in poor performance
                 relative to similar facilities coded in standard
                 programming languages such as FORTRAN and C. Scratchpad
                 development stopped in 1976 giving way to a new system
                 design that evolved into AXIOM. AXIOM has a
                 strongly-typed programming language for building a
                 library of parameterized types and algorithms, and a
                 type-inferencing interpreter that accesses the library
                 and can build any of an infinite number of types for
                 interactive use. We suggest that the addition of an
                 expression tree type to AXIOM can allow users to
                 operate with the same freedom and convenience of
                 untyped systems without giving up the expressive power
                 and run-time efficiency provided by the type system. We
                 also present a design that supports a multiplicity of
                 programming styles, from the Scratchpad
                 pattern-matching paradigm to functional programming to

  abstract =     "Algorithms for computing integral bases of an
                 algebraic function field are implemented in some
                 computer algebra systems. They are used e.g. for the
                 integration of algebraic functions. The method used by
                 Maple 5.2 and AXIOM is given by B. M. Trager (1984). He
                 adapted an algorithm of Ford and Zassenhaus (1978),
                 that computes the ring of integers in an algebraic
                 number field, to the case of a function field. It turns
                 out that using algebraic geometry one can write a
                 faster algorithm. The method we give is based on
                 Puiseux expansions. One can see this as a variant on
                 the Coates' algorithm as it is described by Davenport
                 (1981). Some difficulties in computing with Puiseux
                 expansions can be avoided using a sharp bound for the
                 number of terms required which are given. We derive
                 which denominator is needed in the integral basis.
                 Using this result `intermediate expression swell' can
                 be avoided. The Puiseux expansions generally introduce
                 algebraic extensions.",

  abstract =     "Dynamic evaluation is a technique for producing
                 multiple results according to a decision tree which
                 evolves with program execution. Sometimes we need to
                 produce results for all possible branches in the
                 decision tree, while on other occasions it may be
                 sufficient to compute a single result which satisfies
                 certain properties. This technique finds use in
                 computer algebra where computing the correct result
                 depends on recognising and properly handling special
                 cases of parameters. In previous work, programs using
                 dynamic evaluation have explored all branches of
                 decision trees by repeating the computations prior to
                 decision points. The paper presents two new
                 implementations of dynamic evaluation which avoid
                 recomputing intermediate results. The first approach
                 uses Scheme `continuations' to record the state for
                 resuming program execution. The second implementation
                 uses the Unix `fork' operation to form new processes to
                 explore alternative branches in parallel. These
                 implementations are based on modifications to Lisp- and
                 C-based run-time systems for the Axiom Version 2
                 extension language (previously known as
                 $A^{\mbox{Hash}}$). This allows the same high-level
                 source code to be compared using the `re-evaluation',
                 the `continuation', and the `fork' implementations.",
