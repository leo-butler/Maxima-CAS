                 arbitrary univariate expression as a truncated series
                 in Chebyshev polynomials and manipulating such
                 expansions are described. A data structure is
                 introduced to represent a truncated expansion in a set
                 of orthogonal polynomials which contains the
                 independent variable, the name of the orthogonal
                 polynomial set, the number of terms retained, and a
                 list of the expansion coefficients. The package
                 converts a given expression into the aforementioned
                 data structure. Special cases are the conversion of
                 sums, products, the ratio, or the composition of
                 truncated Chebyshev expansions. Another special case is
                 converting an expression free of truncated Chebyshev
                 expansions. The package generates exact expansion
                 coefficients whenever possible. In addition to
                 well-known Chebyshev expansions, such as for

                 algorithm for the symbolic integration of rational
                 functions containing nested exponential and logarithms.
                 For the class of transcendental functions, the Risch
                 algorithm represents a practical method for symbolic
                 integration. Because the Risch algorithm describes a
                 decision procedure for transcendental integration it is
                 an ideal final step in an integration package. Although
                 the decision characteristic cannot be fully realised in
                 a computer system, because of major algebraic problems
                 such as factorisation, zero-equivalence and
                 simplification, the potential advantages are
                 considerable. The symbolic language, MACSYMA contains
                 an implementation of the Risch algorithm which will be
                 examined and compared for functionality with an
                 implementation written for the symbolic/numeric system
                 SENAC. Several elementary transcendental integrals are
                 presented to analyse MACSYMA's implementation. The

  abstract =     "In MACSYMA, there are procedures for solving systems
                 of equations, such as solve and linsolve. Because the
                 systems of equations we are dealing with are mostly
                 sparse, the application of Gaussian elimination which
                 is used in linsolve produces results that are usually
                 lengthy and inefficient. The authors have implemented a
                 new derivation procedure to solve the problem of
                 expression growth and increase the computational
                 efficiency. The underlying concept is the
                 identification of the smallest full subsystems
                 contained within the original and then subsequent
                 remaining systems, labeling common terms by
                 intermediate variables. Gaussian elimination is
                 employed to solve these subsystems independently and
                 sequentially instead of the complete system.",

                 a graphical, interactive tool for specifying the
                 handling of Jacobian matrices and linear solvers. It
                 automates such routine but difficult tasks as correctly
                 converting from the data structures used for computing
                 the Jacobian to data structures used by a linear
                 solver. The user specifies what to do only at a high,

  abstract =     "Formal Laurent-Puisieux series (LPS) are important in
                 calculus and complex analysis. In some computer algebra
                 systems (CASs) it is possible to define an LPS by
                 direct or recursive definition of its coefficients.
                 Since some operations cannot be directly supported
                 within the LPS domain, some systems generally convert
                 LPS to finite truncated LPS for operations such as
                 addition, multiplication, division, inversion and
                 formal substitution. This results in a substantial loss
                 of information. Since a goal of computer algebra is to
                 work with formal objects and preserve such symbolic
                 information, CAS should be able to use LPS when
                 possible. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
                 formal power series with positive radius of convergence
                 and corresponding analytic functions. It should be
                 possible to automate conversion between these forms.
                 Among CASs only MACSYMA provides a procedure power
                 series to calculate LPS from analytic expressions in
                 certain special cases, but this is rather limited. W.
                 Koepf (1992) gave an algorithmic approach for computing
                 an LPS for a very rich family of functions. It covers
                 e.g. a high percentage of the power series that are
                 listed in the special series dictionary (E. R. Hansen,
                 1975). the algorithm has been implemented by W. Koepf
                 and A. Rennoch in the CAS Mathematica (1991). The
                 author presents some example results of the Mathematica
                 implementation which gives insight in the underlying
                 algorithmic procedure. (7 Refs.)",

  abstract =     "Many numerical methods used in power system simulation
                 require the computation of Jacobian matrices. This
                 being particularly true for implicit integration
                 algorithms, and not for explicit ones. These
                 computations often take a significant proportion of the
                 overall CPU time. This paper presents an application of
                 the automatic differentiation method which results in
                 large savings in the computation of Jacobian matrices.
                 An original application of this method is in a software
                 which simulates power systems dynamics. As the program
                 enables the users to introduce their own models,
                 automatic differentiation becomes particularly
                 efficient. In comparison with numerical
                 differentiation, it leads to a saving of 80\% of the
                 time required for the computation of the Jacobian
                 matrices and up to 28\% of the total CPU time.
                 Automatic differentiation is a very efficient method
                 which should be valuable to other power system
                 software, in particular those which offer users the
                 possibility of defining their own models.",

                 and MACSYMA are readily available for a wide range of
                 PCs and workstations. Many college campuses have site
                 licenses for these software tools and make them widely
                 available to students through PC labs, across networks,
                 and on time-sharing systems. In addition, student
                 versions of these software tools are widely available
                 at nominal cost. Computer algebra systems provide
                 sophisticated computational support and are intuitive
                 to use. In this article we describe how we use Maple to
                 support an upper-division undergraduate course teaching
                 elementary queueing theory. We discuss the significant
                 enhancement added by using Maple for this coursework.
                 We present the traditional approach to this material
                 (i.e., deriving the closed form solutions for a
                 specific queueing model), then we show how we approach
                 the material using numerical solutions based on the
                 general equations for steady state probabilities for a
                 Poisson Birth-Death process. We present several

                 cylinders in the Taylor-Couette flow problem are
                 assumed to rotate at different angular velocities. The
                 geometrical and kinematic parameters can be chosen
                 arbitrarily. The model equation for the material law of
                 the viscoelastic liquid is based on the thermodynamic
                 model for dilute solutions due to Lhuillier and
                 Ouibrahim (1980) which is an analogy to the earlier
                 paper of Frankel and Acrivos (1970). In the present
                 investigation the influence of the parameters of the
                 viscoelastic model on the velocity profile in the
                 cylindrical gap is studied and the range of validity of
                 the constitutive equation is investigated. (8 Refs.)",
