                 problems have considerable structure in their

                 conservation laws and the nature of our approximation
                 techniques. The exploitation of this structure is
                 often the reason why hand calculations of non-trivial
                 problems are possible. However, most available algebra
                 systems do not preserve such structure in a consistent
