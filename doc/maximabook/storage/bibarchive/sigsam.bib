  abstract =     "Comparing the speed of computation in algebra systems
                 is a perennial occupation of system designers and
                 algorithm implementors. However, for many problems, the
                 choice of a system makes much less difference that the
                 approach used to represent the problem. The mapping
                 from mathematics to a data representation and the
                 choice of algorithms can make significant, and
                 separate, contributions to efficiency. Systems which
                 have the flexibility to provide several data structures
                 and algorithms can provide an advantage in this
                 respect. Macsyma is probably the system with the
                 largest selection. On the other hand, Macsyma has not
                 taken advantage of recent advances such as the
                 extensive use of hash-coding incorporated in the
                 University of Waterloo's Maple system. For the one
                 somewhat artificial benchmark discussed, it appears
                 that the Maple system does considerably better than any
                 representation in Macsyma by precisely this
                 mechanism.",

  abstract =     "Wide distribution of the computer algebra system
                 Mathematica has encouraged numerous programmers,
                 researchers and educators to produce libraries of
                 programs in its special language, for incorporation as
                 'packages' into Mathematica systems. Some authors have
                 found that the Mathematica proprietary computer program
                 has problematical and difficult-to-alter semantics. An
                 initial step in opening up such user-written libraries
                 to re-use is an independent re-implementation of the
                 language via a non-proprietary parser. The author
                 describes a parser written in Common Lisp, a language
                 which is appropriate for three reasons: it is a
                 standard and has wide distribution; it supports
                 numerous useful features including automatic storage
                 allocation and garbage collection, arbitrary-precision
                 integers and tools for lexical scanning of languages;
                 and Lisp is the host language for several algebraic
                 manipulation systems whose subroutines may be of some
                 interest for programmers implementing alternative
                 semantics.",

  abstract =     "The paper uses the Bergman kernel method (BKM) for
                 solving conformal mapping problems. In contrast to most
                 conformal mapping techniques, the approximation of the
                 solution is an analytic function. The main drawback of
                 the method, however, is that it involves an
                 orthonormalization process and thus is numerically
                 unstable. This disadvantage can be overcome by using
                 the Maple system which makes no use of Gaussian
                 quadrature, so that approximation errors are almost
                 entirely avoided. It tested how some typical domains
                 can be treated. Using theorems of Walsh (1929) and
                 Simonenko (1978) it determines a number N such that the
                 error of the N-th approximation of the mapping function
                 remains under a desired value. It compares the obtained
                 results to the sharp asymptotic estimates of Gaier
                 (1988) and to numerical results of Levin, Papamichael

                 produces a differential equation satisfied by
                 A(x):=/sub - infinity / integral /sup infinity
                 /F(x,y)dy. A function F(x,y) is hyperexponential if
                 both F/sub x/(x,y)/F(x,y) and F/sub y/(x,y)/F(x,y) are
                 rational functions of (x,y). A(x) always satisfies a
                 linear differential equation with polynomial

                 implements that algorithm. The same algorithm, and

                 three products, SENAC, InterCall and IRENA. Each of the
                 three is in the Numerical Algorithms Group (Fortran
                 77). SENAC is a package developed by the Mathematical
                 Software Project at the University of Waikato. SENAC
                 includes a symbolic manipulation interpreter (Sencore),
                 together with high level interfaces to the NAG Fortran
                 Library (Numlink) and NAG Graphics Library (Graflink).
                 The system evolved from an interface, Naglink, between
                 the NAG Library and the symbolic manipulation language
                 Macsyma. The Sensore interpreter is written in Common
                 LISP and belongs to the Macsyma/Maple/Reduce family of
                 languages. It is easy to load user-written files
                 written in Common LISP or in SENAC. InterCall is a
                 Mathematica package that enables its user to
                 interactively call external code, for example from an
                 external numeric library. It allows various default
                 settings to be defined for any arguments that need to
                 be passed to any routine in that code, and initial
                 default settings for all the routines in the IMSL and
                 NAG libraries are included with InterCall in the form
                 of a small defaults-database file. IRENA-an Interface
                 from Reduce to NAG-runs under the Reduce computer
                 algebra system and provides an interactive front end to
                 the NAG Library. It has been designed to make the use
                 of the NAG Library considerably simpler, in a number of
                 ways.",

                 automatically reducing a nonlinear equation system
                 beforehand, by use of successive substitutions. The
                 algorithm treats the equation system as a graph, is
                 heuristic, and automatically chooses what substitutions
                 are likely to yield, at the end, the highest size
                 reduction. This system must not necessarily be
                 polynomial, can even be ill defined (then the algorithm
                 just performs reduction) and can be used even in the
                 presence of transcendental or a priori unknown
                 functions. Two implementations have been made, one for
                 FORTRAN, quicker but less efficient, and one in the
                 computer algebra language MACSYMA, slower but with
                 better reduction. The promises of computer algebra in
                 this field are investigated. Applications are then
                 presented to the reduction of equations systems

                 useful to solve systems of algebraic equations with a
                 finite number of solutions. Nevertheless, as stated by
                 B. Buchberger (1985), numerical accuracy attainable
                 when using floating point arithmetic is not yet
                 studied. The author discusses a numerical approach,
                 defining conveniently the condition number of every
                 root, and the numerical GCDs of Buchberger's algorithm.
                 With these instruments he is able to compute
                 confidence-intervals for the roots. He completes the
                 study with two illustrative examples. The author also

  abstract =     "Formal Laurent-Puisieux series (LPS) are important in
                 calculus and complex analysis. In some computer algebra
                 systems (CASs) it is possible to define an LPS by
                 direct or recursive definition of its coefficients.
                 Since some operations cannot be directly supported
                 within the LPS domain, some systems generally convert
                 LPS to finite truncated LPS for operations such as
                 addition, multiplication, division, inversion and
                 formal substitution. This results in a substantial loss
                 of information. Since a goal of computer algebra is to
                 work with formal objects and preserve such symbolic
                 information, CAS should be able to use LPS when
                 possible. There is a one-to-one correspondence between
                 formal power series with positive radius of convergence
                 and corresponding analytic functions. It should be
                 possible to automate conversion between these forms.
                 Among CASs only MACSYMA provides a procedure power
                 series to calculate LPS from analytic expressions in
                 certain special cases, but this is rather limited. W.
                 Koepf (1992) gave an algorithmic approach for computing
                 an LPS for a very rich family of functions. It covers
                 e.g. a high percentage of the power series that are
                 listed in the special series dictionary (E. R. Hansen,
                 1975). the algorithm has been implemented by W. Koepf
                 and A. Rennoch in the CAS Mathematica (1991). The
                 author presents some example results of the Mathematica
                 implementation which gives insight in the underlying
                 algorithmic procedure. (7 Refs.)",

  abstract =     "J. Kovacic (J. Symb. Comp., vol. 2, pp. 3-43, 1986)
                 gave an algorithm for solving second-order linear
                 homogeneous differential equations. This algorithm,
                 known as the Kovacic algorithm, computes the
                 Liouvillian solutions of L(y)=y'-ry=0 (with r in C(x)).
                 Since exponential solutions of linear differential
                 equations are in general more difficult to compute than
                 rational solutions, we propose an algorithm where
                 rational solutions of symmetric powers are used as much
                 as possible instead of exponential solutions. The
                 advantage of our approach is (1) to give a simple proof
                 of a Kovacic-like algorithm for arbitrary coefficient
                 fields and to give a complete overview of all the
                 possible polynomials; (2) to provide an
                 easy-to-implement algorithm using only rational
                 solutions for completely reducible groups G(L)
                 contained in SL(2,C); and (3) to avoid algebraic
                 extensions of the constant field by using rational
                 solutions instead of exponential solutions of symmetric
                 powers. The algorithm as been implemented in the Maple
                 system and should soon find its way into the Maple
                 share library. The new version is always faster than
                 the current Maple implementation of the Kovacic
                 algorithm, especially for example where G(L) is a
                 finite primitive subgroup of SL(2,C) and where the
                 current implementation fails to answer in most cases.",
