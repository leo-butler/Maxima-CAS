                 often is obtained by numerical integration on the
                 digital computer. These solutions are usually
                 expensive and limit the scope of the dynamic study.
                 The proposed improved technique results in a
                 substantial increase in the computational efficiency

                 explicit equations of motion algebraically prior to
