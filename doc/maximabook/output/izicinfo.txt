There does exist an interface to a fourth program, called IZIC, which
  was capable of excellent graphics.  Unfortunately, while the bindings still
  exist in Maxima, IZIC itself has not been maintained in quite some time and
  depends on a version of Tk so old most Linux distributions do not even have
  the ability to emulate the calls it needs.  So until someone updates it, this
  inteface must remain in limbo.  The old IZIC code can be obtained via ftp at
  zenon.inria.fr, and there is a webpage at
  http://www-sop.inria.fr/safir/SAM/Izic/ with some example pictures.  The basic ZIC code appears to compile, with some minor fixes, but the TCL/TK code will most likely need some serious effort.
