\section{Introduction \label{sec:introduction}}

To invoke MAXIMA in Linux, type
\begin{verbatim}
maxima<ret>
\end{verbatim}


The computer will display a greeting of the sort:
\begin{verbatim}
GCL (GNU Common Lisp)  Version(2.3) ter jun 27 14:16:29 BRT 2000                                        
Licensed under GNU Library General Public License
Contains Enhancements by W. Schelter
Maxima 5.4 ter jun 27 14:16:11 BRT 2000 (with enhancements by W. Schelter).
Licensed under the GNU Public License (see file COPYING)
(C1)                                                                                                    
\end{verbatim}

The {\tt (C1)} is a ``label''.  Each input or output line is labelled and can be referred to by its
own label for the rest of the session.  {\tt C} labels denote your commands and {\tt D} labels
denote Displays of the machine's response.  \emph{Never use variable names like {\tt C1} or {\tt
D5}, as these will be confused with the lines so labeled}.

MAXIMA is pragmatic about lower and upper case: regardless of your typing {\tt sin(x)} or {\tt
SIN(x)},
{\tt \verb+%e^x+} or {\tt \verb+%E^x+}, it will understand that you mean the sine and exponential
functions, and will echo in standard uppercase {\tt SIN} and {\tt \verb+%E+}.
\emph{That doesn't apply to user variables, though: {\tt x} and {\tt X} are \emph{different}
variables for MAXIMA ! (Try it.)}





\section{Special keys and symbols \label{sec:keys}}

\begin{enumerate}
\item To end a MAXIMA session, type {\tt quit();}.  If you type \verb+^C+, here is what happens:
\begin{verbatim}
Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by MACSYMA-TOP-LEVEL.
If continued: Type :r to resume execution, or :q to quit to top level.
Broken at SYSTEM:TERMINAL-INTERRUPT.  Type :H for Help.
MAXIMA>>:q
 
(C1)     
\end{verbatim}
Notice that typing {\tt :q} or {\tt :t} (for \emph{top level}) after the {\tt MAXIMA>>} prompt gets
you back to the MAXIMA level.
\verb+^Y+, on the other hand, won't have any effect but being echoed on the screen; finally 
\verb+^Z+ will have the same effect as {\tt quit();}. (Here \verb+^+ stands for the control key, so
that \verb+^C+ means first press the key marked control and hold it down while pressing the C key.)

\item To abort a computation without leaving MAXIMA, type \verb+^C+.  It is important for you to
know how to do this in case, for example, you begin a computation which is taking too long.
Remember to type {\tt :q} at the {\tt MAXIMA>>} prompt to return to MAXIMA. For example:
\begin{verbatim}
(C1) sum(1/x^2,x,1,1000);
 
 
Correctable error: Console interrupt.
Signalled by MACSYMA-TOP-LEVEL.
If continued: Type :r to resume execution, or :q to quit to top level.
Broken at SYSTEM:TERMINAL-INTERRUPT.  Type :H for Help.
MAXIMA>>:q
 
(C2)                                                                                                    
\end{verbatim}

\item In order to tell MAXIMA that you have finished your command, use the semicolon ({\tt ;}),
followed by a return.  Note that the return key alone does not signal that you are done with your
input.

\item An alternative input terminator to the semicolon ({\tt ;}) is the dollar sign ({\tt \$}),
which, however, supresses the display of MAXIMA's computation.  This is useful if you are computing
some long intermediate result, and you don't want to waste time having it displayed on the screen.

%\item If you want to completely delete the current input line (and start this line fresh from the
%beginning), type a double question mark ({\tt ??}).

\item If you wish to repeat a command which you have already given, say on line {\tt (C5)}, you may
do so without typing it over again by preceding its label with two single quotes ({\tt ''}), i.e., {\tt
''C5}. (Note that simply inputing {\tt C5} will not do the job --- try it.)

\item If you want to refer to the immediately preceding result computed my MAXIMA, you can either
use its {\tt D} label, or you can use the special symbol percent   ({\tt \%}).

\item The standard quantities $e$ (natural log base), $i$ (square root of $-1$) and $\pi$
($3.14159\ldots$) are respectively referred to as \verb+%e+ (or \verb+%E+), \verb+%i+ 
(or \verb+%I+), and \verb+%pi+ (or \verb+%PI+).  Note that the use of {\tt \%} here as a prefix
is completely unrelated to the use of {\tt \%} to refer to the preceding result computed.

\item In order to assign a value to a variable, MAXIMA uses the colon ({\tt :}), not the equal
sign.  The equal sign is used for representing equations.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Arithmetic \label{sec:arithmetic}}

The common arithmetic operations are
\begin{description}
   \item [{\tt +}] addition
   \item [{\tt -}] subtraction
   \item [{\tt *}] scalar multiplication
   \item [{\tt /}] division
   \item [{\tt \^}]  or {\tt **} exponentiation
   \item [{\tt .}] matrix multiplication
   \item [{\tt sqrt(x)}] square root of {\tt x}.
\end{description}
MAXIMA's output is characterized by exact (rational) arithmetic.  E.g.,
\begin{verbatim}
(C1) 1/100+1/101;
 
                                      201
(D1)                                 -----
                                     10100                                                              
\end{verbatim}
If irrational numbers are involved in a computation, they are kept in symbolic form:
\begin{verbatim}
(C2) (1+sqrt(2))^5;
 
                                             5
(D2)                            (SQRT(2) + 1)
(C3) expand(%);
 
(D3)                            29 SQRT(2) + 41                                                              
\end{verbatim}
However, it is often useful to express a result in decimal notation.  This may be accomplished by
following the expression you want expanded by ``{\tt ,numer}'':
\begin{verbatim}
(C4) %,numer;
 
(D4)                           82.01219330881976                                                             
\end{verbatim}
Note the use here of \verb+%+ 
to refer to the previous result.  In this version of MAXIMA, {\tt numer} gives 16 significant
figures, of which the last is often unreliable.  However, MAXIMA can offer \emph{arbitrarily high
precision} by using the {\tt bfloat} function:
\begin{verbatim}
(C5) bfloat(d3);
 
(D5)                          8.201219330881976B1                                                            \end{verbatim}
The number of significant figures displayed is controlled by the MAXIMA variable {\tt FPPREC}, which
has the default value of 16:
\begin{verbatim}
(C6) fpprec;
 
(D6)                                  16                                                                     
\end{verbatim}
Here we reset {\tt FPPREC} to yield 100 digits:
\begin{verbatim}
(C7) fpprec:100;
 
(D7)                                  100
(C8) ''c5;
 
(D8) 8.20121933088197564152489730020812442785204843859314941221237124017312418#
 
7540110412666123849550160561B1
\end{verbatim}
Note the use of two single quotes ({\tt ''}) in {\tt (C8)} to repeat command {\tt (C5)}.  MAXIMA can
handle very large numbers without approximation:
\begin{verbatim}
(C9) 100!;
 
(D9) 9332621544394415268169923885626670049071596826438162146859296389521759999#
 
322991560894146397615651828625369792082722375825118521091686400000000000000000#
 
0000000                                                                                                      \end{verbatim}

\section{Algebra \label{sec:algebra}}

MAXIMA's importance as a computer tool to facilitate analytical calculations becomes more evident
when we see how easily it does algebra for us.  Here's an example in which a polynomial is expanded:
\begin{verbatim}
(C1) (x+3*y+x^2*y)^3;
 
                                 2             3
(D1)                           (x  y + 3 y + x)
(C2) expand(%);
 
      6  3      4  3       2  3       3      5  2       3  2         2      4
(D2) x  y  + 9 x  y  + 27 x  y  + 27 y  + 3 x  y  + 18 x  y  + 27 x y  + 3 x  y
 
                                                                       2      3
                                                                  + 9 x  y + x  
\end{verbatim}
Now suppose we wanted to substitute {\tt 5/z} for {\tt x} in the above expression:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
(C3) d2,x=5/z;
 
          2        3                 2               3                  2
     135 y    675 y    225 y   2250 y    125   5625 y    1875 y   9375 y
(D3) ------ + ------ + ----- + ------- + --- + ------- + ------ + -------
       z         2       2        3       3       4         4        5
                z       z        z       z       z         z        z
 
                                                                      3
                                                               15625 y        3
                                                             + -------- + 27 y
                                                                   6
                                                                  z                                          
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
The MAXIMA function RATSIMP will place this over a common denominator:
\begin{verbatim}
(C4) ratsimp(%);
 
          3  6        2  5         3           4          2         3
(D4) (27 y  z  + 135 y  z  + (675 y  + 225 y) z  + (2250 y  + 125) z
 
                                      3            2         2            3   6
                             + (5625 y  + 1875 y) z  + 9375 y  z + 15625 y )/z    
\end{verbatim}
Expressions may also be {\tt factor}ed:
\begin{verbatim}
(C5) factor(%);
 
                                  2              3
                            (3 y z  + 5 z + 25 y)
(D5)                        ----------------------
                                       6
                                      z                                                                      
\end{verbatim}
MAXIMA can obtain exact solutions to systems of nonlinear algebraic equations.  In this example we
{\tt solve} three equations in the three unknowns {\tt A}, {\tt B}, {\tt C}:
\begin{verbatim}
(C6) a + b*c=1;
 
(D6)                              b C + a = 1
(C7) b - a*c=0;
 
(D7)                              b - a C = 0
(C8) a+b=5;
 
(D8)                               b + a = 5
(C9) solve([d6,d7,d8],[a,b,c]);
 
           25 SQRT(79) %I + 25      5 SQRT(79) %I + 5      SQRT(79) %I + 1
(D9) [[a = -------------------, b = -----------------, C = ---------------],
           6 SQRT(79) %I - 34       SQRT(79) %I + 11             10
 
            25 SQRT(79) %I - 25      5 SQRT(79) %I - 5        SQRT(79) %I - 1
       [a = -------------------, b = -----------------, C = - ---------------]]
            6 SQRT(79) %I + 34       SQRT(79) %I - 11               10                     
\end{verbatim}
Note that the display consists of a ``list'', i.e., some expression contained between two brackets
{\tt [ \ldots ]}, which itself contains two lists.  Each of the latter contain a distinct solution
to the simultaneous equations.

Trigonometric identities are easy to manipulate in MAXIMA.  The function {\tt trigexpand} uses the
sum-of-angles formulas to make the argument inside each trig function as simple as possible:
\begin{verbatim}
(C10) sin(u+v)*cos(u)^3;
 
                                 3
(D10)                         COS (u) SIN(v + u)
(C11) trigexpand(%);
 
                       3
(D11)               COS (u) (COS(u) SIN(v) + SIN(u) COS(v))       
\end{verbatim}
The function {\tt trigreduce}, on the other hand, converts an expression into a form which is a sum
of terms, each of which contains only a single {\tt sin} or {\tt cos}:
\begin{verbatim}

(C12) trigreduce(d10);
 
            SIN(v + 4 u) + SIN(v - 2 u)   3 SIN(v + 2 u) + 3 SIN(v)
(D12)       --------------------------- + -------------------------
                         8                            8                               
\end{verbatim}
The functions {\tt realpart} and {\tt imagpart} will return the real and imaginary parts of a
complex expression:
\begin{verbatim}

(C13) w:3+k*%i;
 
(D13)                              %I k + 3
(C14) w^2*%e^w;
 
                                      2   %I k + 3
(D14)                       (%I k + 3)  %E
(C15) realpart(%);
 
                       3       2               3
(D15)                %E  (9 - k ) COS(k) - 6 %E  k SIN(k)                     
\end{verbatim}

\section{Calculus \label{sec:calculus}}

MAXIMA can compute derivatives and integrals, expand in Taylor series, take limits, and obtain exact
solutions to ordinary differential equations.  We begin by defining the symbol {\tt f} to be the
following function of {\tt x}:
\begin{verbatim}
(C1) f:x^3*%E^(k*x)*sin(w*x);
 
                                3   k x
(D1)                           x  %E    SIN(w x)    
\end{verbatim}
We compute the derivative of {\tt f} with respect to {\tt x}:
\begin{verbatim}
(C2) diff(f,x);
 
           3   k x               2   k x               3   k x
(D2)    k x  %E    SIN(w x) + 3 x  %E    SIN(w x) + w x  %E    COS(w x)             
\end{verbatim}
Now we find the indefinite integral of {\tt f} with respect to {\tt x}:
\begin{verbatim}
(C3) integrate(f,x);
 
           6      3  4      5  2    7   3
(D3) (((k w  + 3 k  w  + 3 k  w  + k ) x
 
       6      2  4      4  2      6   2            4       3  2      5
 + (3 w  + 3 k  w  - 3 k  w  - 3 k ) x  + (- 18 k w  - 12 k  w  + 6 k ) x
 
      4       2  2      4    k x
 - 6 w  + 36 k  w  - 6 k ) %E    SIN(w x)
 
        7      2  5      4  3    6     3         5       3  3      5     2
 + ((- w  - 3 k  w  - 3 k  w  - k  w) x  + (6 k w  + 12 k  w  + 6 k  w) x
 
       5       2  3       4              3       3      k x

\end{verbatim}
A slight change in syntax gives definite integrals:
\begin{verbatim}
(C4) integrate(1/x^2,x,1,inf);
 
(D4)                                   1                                                                     
(C5) integrate(1/x,x,0,inf);
 
Integral is divergent
 -- an error.  Quitting.  To debug this try DEBUGMODE(TRUE);)
\end{verbatim}
Next we define the simbol {\tt g} in terms of {\tt f} (previously defined in {\tt C1}) and the
hyperbolic sine function, and find its Taylor series expansion (up to, say, order 3 terms) about the
point {\tt x = 0}:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
(C6) g:f/sinh(k*x)^4;
 
                                3   k x

(C7) taylor(g,x,0,3);
 
                            2    3   2         2    3   3
             w    w x   (w k  + w ) x    (3 w k  + w ) x

             k    k          6 k               6 k                                                           
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}
The limit of {\tt g} as {\tt x} goes to 0 is computed as follows:
\begin{verbatim}
(C8) limit(g,x,0);
 
                                      w
(D8)                                  --
                                       4
                                      k                                                                      \end{verbatim}
MAXIMA also permits derivatives to be represented in unevaluated form (note the quote):
\begin{verbatim}
(C9) 'diff(y,x);
 
                                      dy
(D9)                                  --
                                      dx                                                                     
\end{verbatim}
The quote operator in {\tt (C9)} means ``do not evaluate''.  Without it, MAXIMA would have obtained
0:
\begin{verbatim}
(C10) diff(y,x);
 
(D10)                                  0                
\end{verbatim}
Using the quote operator we can write differential equations:
\begin{verbatim}
(C11) 'diff(y,x,2) + 'diff(y,x) + y;
 
                                  2
                                 d y   dy
(D11)                            --- + -- + y
                                   2   dx
                                 dx                                                                          
\end{verbatim}
MAXIMA's {\tt ODE2} function can solve first and second order ODE's:
\begin{verbatim}
(C12) ode2(d11,y,x);
 
                   - x/2          SQRT(3) x            SQRT(3) x
(D12)        y = %E      (%K1 SIN(---------) + %K2 COS(---------))
                                      2                    2       
\end{verbatim}

\section{Matrix calculations \label{sec:matrix}}

MAXIMA can compute the determinant, inverse and eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices which have
symbolic elements (i.e., elements which involve algebraic variables.) We begin by entering a matrix
{\tt m} element by element:
\begin{verbatim}
(C1) m:entermatrix(3,3);


Is the matrix  1. Diagonal  2. Symmetric  3. Antisymmetric  4. General
Answer 1, 2, 3 or 4 : 4;
Row 1 Column 1:  0;
Row 1 Column 2:  1;
Row 1 Column 3:  a;
Row 2 Column 1:  1;
Row 2 Column 2:  0;
Row 2 Column 3:  1;
Row 3 Column 1:  1;
Row 3 Column 2:  1;
Row 3 Column 3:  0;
 
Matrix entered.
                                  [ 0  1  a ]
                                  [         ]
(D1)                              [ 1  0  1 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ 1  1  0 ]                                                           
\end{verbatim}
Next we find its transpose, determinant and inverse:
\begin{verbatim}
(C2) transpose(m);
 
                                  [ 0  1  1 ]
                                  [         ]
(D2)                              [ 1  0  1 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ a  1  0 ]
(C3) determinant(m);
 
(D3)                                 a + 1
(C4) invert(m),detout;
 
                               [ - 1   a    1  ]
                               [               ]
                               [  1   - a   a  ]
                               [               ]
                               [  1    1   - 1 ]
(D4)                           -----------------
                                     a + 1                                                              
\end{verbatim}
In {\tt (C4)}, the modifier {\tt DETOUT} keeps the determinant outside the inverse.  As a check, we
multiply {\tt m} by its inverse (note the use of the period to represent matrix multiplication):
\begin{verbatim}
(C5) m.d4;

                                      [ - 1   a    1  ]

                                      [  1   - a   a  ]

(C6) expand(%);
 
                [   a       1                                 ]

                [                                             ]
                [                  a       1                  ]

                                  [ 1  0  0 ]
                                  [         ]
(D7)                              [ 0  1  0 ]
                                  [         ]
                                  [ 0  0  1 ]                                                                
\end{verbatim}
In order to find the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of {\tt m}, we use the function {\tt
EIGENVECTORS}:

\noindent\begin{minipage}{\textwidth}
\begin{verbatim}
(C8) eigenvectors(m);
 
Warning - you are redefining the MACSYMA function EIGENVALUES

                  2                  2
 
      SQRT(4 a + 5) - 1    SQRT(4 a + 5) - 1

\end{verbatim}
In {\tt D8}, the first triple gives the eigenvalues of {\tt m} and the next gives their respective
multiplicities (here each is unrepeated).  The next three triples give the corresponding
eigenvectors of {\tt m}.  In order to extract from this expression one of these eigenvectors, we may
use the {\tt PART} function:
\begin{verbatim}
(C9) part(%,2);
 
                       SQRT(4 a + 5) - 1    SQRT(4 a + 5) - 1
(D9)             [1, - -----------------, - -----------------]
                            2 a + 2              2 a + 2                               
\end{verbatim}
\end{minipage}

\section{Programming in MAXIMA \label{sec:programming}}

So far, we have used MAXIMA in the interactive mode, rather like a calculator.  However, for
computations which involve a repetitive sequence of commands, it is better to execute a program.
Here we present a short sample program to calculate the critical points of a function {\tt f} of two
variables {\tt x} and {\tt y}.  The program cues the user to enter the function {\tt f}, then it
computes the partial derivatives $\mathtt{f_x}$ and $\mathtt{f_y}$, and then it uses the MAXIMA
command {\tt SOLVE} to obtain solutions to $\mathtt{f_x = f_y = 0}$.  The program is written outside
of MAXIMA with a text editor, and then loaded into MAXIMA with the {\tt BATCH} command.  Here is the
program listing:
\begin{verbatim}
/* -------------------------------------------------------------------------- 
   this is file critpts.max: 
   as you can see, comments in maxima are like comments in C 

   Nelson Luis Dias, nldias@simepar.br
   created 20000707
   updated 20000707
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
critpts():=(
   print("program to find critical points"),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   asks for a function
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   f:read("enter f(x,y)"),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   echoes it, to make sure
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   print("f = ",f),
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   produces a list with the two partial derivatives of f
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   eqs:[diff(f,x),diff(f,y)],
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   produces a list of unknowns
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   unk:[x,y],
/* ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   solves the system
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------- */
   solve(eqs,unk)   
)$
\end{verbatim}
The program (which is actually a function with no argument) is called {\tt critpts}. Each line is a
valid MAXIMA command which could be executed from the keyboard, and which is separated by the next
command by a comma.  The partial derivatives are stored in a variable named {\tt eqs}, and the
unknowns are stored in {\tt unk}.  Here is a sample run:
\begin{verbatim} 
(C1) batch("critpts.max");
 
 
batching #/home/nldias/work/papers2000/intromax/critpts.max
(C2)
(C2) critpts() := (PRINT("program to find critical points"),
 
f : READ("enter f(x,y)"), PRINT("f = ", f), eqs : [DIFF(f, x), DIFF(f, y)],
 
unk : [x, y], SOLVE(eqs, unk))
(C3) critpts();

f =  (y + x) %E

\end{verbatim}

\section{A partial list of MAXIMA functions}

See the MAXIMA Manual in the {\tt maxima-5.4/info/} directory in texinfo or html format.  From
MAXIMA itself, you can use {\tt DESCRIBE(\textit{function name})}.

\begin{description}
   \item[{\tt ALLROOTS(A)}] Finds all the (generally complex) roots of the polynomial equation {\tt
   A}, and lists them in {\tt NUMER}ical format (i.e. to 16 significant figures).
   \item[{\tt APPEND(A,B)}] Appends the list {\tt B} to the list {\tt A}, resulting in a single
   list.
   \item[{\tt BATCH(A)}] Loads and runs a BATCH program with filename {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt COEFF(A,B,C)}] Gives the coefficient of {\tt B} raised to the power {\tt C} in
   expression {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt CONCAT(A,B)}] Creates the symbol {\tt AB}.
   \item[{\tt CONS(A,B)}] Adds {\tt A} to the list {\tt B} as its first element.
   \item[{\tt DEMOIVRE(A)}] Transforms all complex exponentials in {\tt A} to their trigonometric
   equivalents. 
   \item[{\tt DENOM(A)}] Gives the denominator of {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt DEPENDS(A,B)}] Declares {\tt A} to be a function of {\tt B}.  This is useful for
   writing unevaluated derivatives, as in specifying differential equations.
   \item[{\tt DESOLVE(A,B)}] Attempts to solve a linear system {\tt A} of ODE's for unknowns {\tt B}
   using Laplace transforms.
   \item[{\tt DETERMINANT(A)}] Returns the determinant of the square matrix {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt DIFF(A,B1,C1,B2,C2,\ldots,Bn,Cn)}] Gives the mixed partial derivative of {\tt A} with
   respect to each {\tt Bi}, {\tt Ci} times.  For brevity, {\tt DIFF(A,B,1)} may be represented by
   {\tt DIFF(A,B)}.  {\tt 'DIFF(\ldots)} represents the unevaluated derivative, useful in specifying
   a differential equation.
   \item[{\tt EIGENVALUES(A)}] Returns two lists, the first being the eigenvalues of the square
   matrix {\tt A}, and the second being their respective multiplicities.
   \item[{\tt EIGENVECTORS(A)}] Does everything that {\tt EIGENVALUES} does, and adds a list of the
   eigenvectors of {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt ENTERMATRIX(A,B)}] Cues the user to enter an $\mathtt{A} \times\, \mathtt{B}$ matrix,
   element by element.
   \item[{\tt EV(A,B1,B2,\ldots,Bn)}] Evaluates {\tt A} subject to the conditions {\tt Bi}.  In
   particular the {\tt Bi} may be equations, lists of equations (such as that returned by {\tt
   SOLVE}), or assignments, in which cases {\tt EV} ``plugs'' the {\tt Bi} into {\tt A}.  The {\tt
   Bi} may also be words such as {\tt NUMER} (in which case the result is returned in numerical
   format), {\tt DETOUT} (in which case any matrix inverses in {\tt A} are performed with the
   determinant factored out), or {\tt DIFF} (in which case all differentiations in {\tt A} are
   evaluated, i.e., {\tt 'DIFF} in {\tt A} is replaced by {\tt DIFF}).  For brevity in a manual
   command (i.e., not inside a user-defined function), the {\tt EV} may be dropped, shortening the
   syntax to {\tt A,B1,B2,\ldots,Bn}.
   \item[{\tt EXPAND(A)}] Algebraically expands {\tt A}.  In particular multiplication is
   distributed over addition.
   \item[{\tt EXPONENTIALIZE(A)}] Transforms all trigonometric functions in {\tt A} to their complex
   exponential equivalents.
   \item[{\tt FACTOR(A)}] Factors {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt FREEOF(A,B)}] Is true if the variable {\tt A} is not part of the expression {\tt B}.
   \item[{\tt GRIND(A)}] Displays a variable or function {\tt A} in a compact format.  When used
   with {\tt WRITEFILE} and an editor outside of MAXIMA, it offers a scheme for producing {\tt
   BATCH} files which include MAXIMA-generated expressions.
   \item[{\tt IDENT(A)}] Returns an $\mathtt{A} \times\, \mathtt{A}$ identity matrix.
   \item[{\tt IMAGPART(A)}] Returns the imaginary part of {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt INTEGRATE(A,B)}] Attempts to find the indefinite integral of {\tt A} with respect to
   {\tt B}.
   \item[{\tt INTEGRATE(A,B,C,D)}] Attempts to find the indefinite integral of {\tt A} with respect to
   {\tt B}. taken from $\mathtt{B=C}$ to $\mathtt{B=D}$.  The limits of integration {\tt C} and {\tt
   D} may be taken is {\tt INF} (positive infinity) of {\tt MINF} (negative infinity).
   \item[{\tt INVERT(A)}] Computes the inverse of the square matrix {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt KILL(A)}] Removes the variable {\tt A} with all its assignments and properties from
   the current MAXIMA environment.
   \item[{\tt LIMIT(A,B,C)}] Gives the limit of expression {\tt A} as variable {\tt B} approaches
   the value {\tt C}.  The latter may be taken as {\tt INF} of {\tt MINF} as in {\tt INTEGRATE}.
   \item[{\tt LHS(A)}] Gives the left-hand side of the equation {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt LOADFILE(A)}] Loads a disk file with filename {\tt A} from the current default
   directory.  The disk file must be in the proper format (i.e. created by a {\tt SAVE} command).
   \item[{\tt MAKELIST(A,B,C,D)}] Creates a list of {\tt A}'s (each of which presumably depends on
   {\tt B}), concatenated from $\mathtt{B=C}$ to $\mathtt{B=D}$
   \item[{\tt MAP(A,B)}] Maps the function {\tt A} onto the subexpressions of {\tt B}.
   \item[{\tt MATRIX(A1,A2,\ldots,An)}] Creates a matrix consisting of the rows {\tt Ai}, where each
   row {\tt Ai} is a list of {\tt m} elements, {\tt [B1, B2, \ldots, Bm]}.
   \item[{\tt NUM(A)}] Gives the numerator of {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt ODE2(A,B,C)}] Attempts to solve the first- or second-order ordinary differential
   equation {\tt A} for {\tt B} as a function of {\tt C}.
   \item[{\tt PART(A,B1,B2,\ldots,Bn)}] First takes the {\tt B1}th part of {\tt A}, then the {\tt
   B2}th part of that, and so on.
   \item[{\tt PLAYBACK(A)}] Displays the last {\tt A} (an integer) labels and their associated
   expressions.  If {\tt A} is omitted, all lines are played back.  See the Manual for other
   options.
   \item[{\tt RATSIMP(A)}] Simplifies {\tt A} and returns a quotient of two polynomials.
   \item[{\tt REALPART(A)}] Returns the real part of {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt RHS(A)}] Gives the right-hand side of the equation {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt SAVE(A,B1,B2,\ldots, Bn)}] Creates a disk file with filename {\tt A} in the current
   default directory, of variables, functions, or arrays {\tt Bi}.  The format of the file permits
   it to be reloaded into MAXIMA using the {\tt LOADFILE} command.  Everything (including labels)
   may be {\tt SAVE}d by taking {\tt B1} equal to {\tt ALL}.
   \item[{\tt SOLVE(A,B)}] Attempts to solve the algebraic equation {\tt A} for the unknown {\tt B}.  A
   list of solution equations is returned.  For brevity, if {\tt A} is an equation of the form
   $\mathtt{C = 0}$, it may be abbreviated simply by the expression {\tt C}.
   \item[{\tt STRING(A)}] Converts {\tt A} to MACSYMA's linear notation (similar to FORTRAN's) just as if
   it had been typed in and puts {\tt A} into the
    buffer for possible editing.  The STRING'ed expression should not be used in a computation. 
   \item[{\tt STRINGOUT(A,B1,B2,\ldots,Bn)}] Creates a disk file with filename {\tt A} in the current
   default directory, of variables (e.g. labels) {\tt Bi}.  The file is in a text format and is not
   reloadable into MAXIMA. However the strungout expressions can be incorporated into a FORTRAN,
   BASIC or C program with a minimum of editing.
   \item[{\tt SUBST(A,B,C)}] Substitutes {\tt A} for {\tt B} in {\tt C}.
   \item[{\tt TAYLOR(A,B,C,D)}] Expands {\tt A} in a Taylor series in {\tt B} about $\mathtt{B=C}$,
   up to and including the term $\mathtt{(B-C)^D}$.  MAXIMA also supports Taylor expansions in more
   than one independent variable; see the Manual for details.
   \item[{\tt TRANSPOSE(A)}] Gives the transpose of the matrix {\tt A}.
   \item[{\tt TRIGEXPAND(A)}] Is a trig simplification function which uses the sum-of-angles
   formulas to simplify the arguments of individual {\tt SIN}'s or {\tt COS}'s.  For example, 
   {\tt trigexpand(sin(x+y))} gives {\tt COS(x) SIN(y) + SIN(x) COS(y)}.
   \item[{\tt TRIGREDUCE(A)}] Is a trig simplification function which uses trig identities to
   convert products and powers of {\tt SIN} and {\tt COS} into a sum of terms, each of which
   contains only a single {\tt SIN} or {\tt COS}.  For example, \verb+trigreduce(sin(x)^2)+ gives
   {\tt (1 - COS(2x))/2}.
   \item[{\tt TRIGSIMP(A)}] Is a trig simplification function which replaces {\tt TAN}, {\tt SEC},
   etc., by their {\tt SIN} and {\tt COS} equivalents.  It also uses the identity 
   $\mathtt{SIN()^2 +   COS()^2 = 1}$.
