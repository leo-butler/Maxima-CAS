CharSets is a program which I translated from the Maple package CharSets,
written by Dr. Dongming Wang.
A good reference for Characteristic sets is his book Elimination Methods.

I wish to thank Dr. Wang for making this code available to the maxima
project.  I also wish to thank Dr. Willis, Dr. Fateman and Mr. Dotson for
their assistance with this project.
Finally, I wish to dedicate this work to the late Dr. Paul Karmel.
