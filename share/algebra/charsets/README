CharSets is a program which I translated from the Maple package CharSets,
written by Dr. Dongming Wang.  His homepage is  http://calfor.lip6.fr/~wang.
A good reference for Characteristic sets is his book Elimination Methods.

I wish to thank Dr. Wang for making this code available to the maxima
project.  I also wish to thank Dr. Willis, Dr. Fateman and Mr. Dotson for
their assistance with this project.
Finally, I wish to dedicate this work to the late Dr. Paul Karmel.

The CharSets package depends on the set functions in set.lisp, which was
previously in maxima/src/ and is now in maxima/share/algebra/charsets/.
To use CharSets, set.lisp must be loaded first, as it is no longer part
of the compiled Maxima code. For general use, nset.lisp in
maxima/share/contrib/nset/ supersedes set.lisp.
