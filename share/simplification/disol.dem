/* ISOLATE is difficult to use when there is more than
        one variable of interest.  For example, suppose one wished
        to isolate the following expression with respect to A, B, E: */
EXP1:A*(B*(C+D)+E*(F+G));
/*  DISOLATE can be used in such situations: */
LOAD(DISOL)$
DISOLATE(EXP1,A,B,E);
