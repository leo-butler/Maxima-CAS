RNCOMBINE(exp) transforms exp by combining all terms of exp that have
  identical denominators or denominators that differ from each other by
  numerical factors only.  This is slightly different from the behavior
  of COMBINE, which collects terms that have identical denominators.
  Setting PFEFORMAT:TRUE and using COMBINE will achieve results similar
  to those that can be obtained with RNCOMBINE, but RNCOMBINE takes the
  additional step of cross-multiplying numerical denominator factors.
  This results in neater forms, and the possiblity of recognizing some
  cancellations.  Bugs to ASB.
