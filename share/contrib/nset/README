The nset package provides set functions, such as intersection and 
union, for finite sets that are defined by explicit enumeration. 
Unlike the package set in Maxima's share library, nset ("n" for new)
treats lists and sets as distinct objects. This feature makes it possible to
work with sets that have members that are either lists or sets.

To install nset, follow the directions in nset.html.
