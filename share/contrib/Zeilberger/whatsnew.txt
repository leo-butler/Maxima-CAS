WHAT'S NEW (Version 3.0)

The new version of the package adds the following features
to version 2.0:

(1) Gosper's algorithm for indefinite summation
available through the new commands: 
(i) "Gosper" (finds the rational certificate) 
(ii) "AntiDifference" (finds the hypergeometric antidifference)
(iii) "GosperSum" (sums over a given interval by invoking "AntiDifference")

Remark: Gosper's algorithm is now integrated by "Zeilberger" and it
is invoked by default as first attempt.

(2) Warnings (about trivial solutions, terms not depending on the
recurrence variable, dimension of the solutions higher than one, etc...).

(3) Numerical/Modular test for discarding zero-solution systems
in "parGosper" and "Zeilberger".

(4) Lots of settings available (see "readme.txt" and "settings.mc").

(4) Cleaner code.

(5) More verbosity levels.
