The easiest way to use the pregexp code is to simply
load the file pregexp.scm into your Scheme.  

If you use Common Lisp, load pregexp.lisp.

Alternatively, if your Scheme dialect is either PLT
Scheme, Gauche, Guile, or Scsh, you can exploit
your dialect's module facility.  A module-ized pregexp
has two advantages: (a) It makes the interface to the
pregexp code cleaner, as the module hides
implementation details and avoids polluting the global
namespace.  (b) Portions of the pregexp code are
rewritten to take advantage of the dialect's
extensions.

Use the scmxlate package to
configure pregexp for these dialects.  scmxlate is
available from
http://www.ccs.neu.edu/~dorai/scmxlate/scmxlate.html 

Start Scheme in the pregexp directory, and load the
file scmxlate/scmxlate.scm , using the correct relative
or full pathname.  You will be asked your Scheme
dialect name: answer plt, gauche, guile, or scsh
as appropriate.

SECTION 1.

For PLT, the generated file is pregexp.ss ,
which can be loaded using the require syntax.  If you
place pregexp.ss in a standard PLT library location,
you can load it with

(require (lib "pregexp.ss"))

without worrying about its pathname.

-

SECTION 2.

For Gauche, the generated file is
gauchelib/pregexp.scm.  If you place it
in one of the directories in *load-path*, you can
do

(use pregexp)

without worrying about its pathname.

SECTION 3.

For Guile, the generated file is ice-9/pregexp.scm
(ie, the file pregexp.scm  in the subdirectory ice-9 ).
If you place pregexp.scm in an ice-9
subdirectory in your
%load-path, you can load it with

(use-modules (ice-9 pregexp))

-

SECTION 4.

For Scsh, the generated file is
scsh/pregexp.scm .  Move it to an appropriate
library location.  To load the pregexp module in
Scsh, you need to do the following (with
the correct pathname for pregexp.scm).

,config ,load pregexp.scm
,open pregexp
