Subject: `i' modifier in pregexp cloister doesn't carry past closures

Would you please check this out?  The problem seems a bit complex, so
I'm not sure I got the description right, but it should help with
debugging.

The case-folding `i' modifier, used within a cloister, only seems to
apply up to an embedded closure.  This problem also seems to affect
character classes within the regex controlled by the cloister, but
following the closure.

I seem to have this problem in both Bigloo and MzScheme, though I have
not notified the MzScheme team.  If you have any more questions about
this, please let me know.
