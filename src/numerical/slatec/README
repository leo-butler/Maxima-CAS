Numerical routines for use with Maxima.

These are routines converted from the original Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp via f2cl.  The Fortran code is stored in the
fortran directory.  (Some of the code may have been slightly modified
from the original code obtained from www.netlib.org, but the original
versions are stored in CVS.)

Here is a simple script used to convert the Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp.

(dolist (f (directory "numerical/slatec/fortran/*.f"))
  (let ((lisp-path
	 (make-pathname :directory (remove "fortran" (pathname-directory f)
					   :test #'string=)
			:name (pathname-name f)
			:type "lisp")))
    (f2cl::f2cl f :output-file lisp-path :array-type :simple-array 
      :array-slicing nil :package "SLATEC" :float-format
      'double-float)))

It is important that the options given above to f2cl are used,
especially the array-slicing, package, and float-format options.  If
these are wrong, the resulting code may not work with maxima.
