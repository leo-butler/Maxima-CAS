Numerical routines for use with Maxima.

These are routines converted from the original Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp via f2cl.  The Fortran code is stored in the
fortran directory.  (Some of the code may have been slightly modified
from the original code obtained from www.netlib.org, but the original
versions are stored in CVS.)

Here is a simple script used to convert the Fortran code from the
SLATEC library to Lisp.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
(dolist (f (directory "numerical/slatec/fortran/*.f"))
  (let ((lisp-path
	 (make-pathname :directory (remove "fortran" (pathname-directory f)
					   :test #'string=)
			:name (pathname-name f)
			:type "lisp")))
    (f2cl::f2cl f :output-file lisp-path :array-type :simple-array 
      :array-slicing nil :package "SLATEC" :float-format
      'double-float)))

(f2cl::f2cl "numerical/slatec/fortran/dbesj.f"
	    :output-file "numerical/slatec/dbesj.lisp"
	    :array-slicing t
	    :package "SLATEC" :float-format 'double-float)

(f2cl::f2cl "numerical/slatec/fortran/dasyjy.f"
	    :output-file "numerical/slatec/dasyjy.lisp"
	    :array-slicing nil
	    :array-type :array
	    :package "SLATEC" :float-format 'double-float)

(f2cl::f2cl "numerical/slatec/fortran/dasyik.f"
	    :output-file "numerical/slatec/dasyik.lisp"
	    :array-slicing nil
	    :array-type :array
	    :package "SLATEC" :float-format 'double-float)

(f2cl::f2cl "numerical/slatec/fortran/dbesi.f"
	    :output-file "numerical/slatec/dbesi.lisp"
	    :array-slicing t
	    :package "SLATEC" :float-format 'double-float)

However, dbesj needs to be compiled as above because it slices an
array for use by DASYJY.  Therefore, DASYJY needs to be compiled as
above since it's not given a simple-array.  Same thing holds for
dasyik and dbesi.

It is important that the options given above to f2cl are used,
especially the array-slicing, package, and float-format options.  If
these are wrong, the resulting code may not work with maxima.

Also, the converted files were done using CMUCL.  If some other Lisp
is used, the formatting of the files may be totally different.
