Install imaxima by unpacking the tarball and doing the usual incantation

     ./configure
     make
     make install

and put

     (autoload 'imaxima "imaxima" "Image support for Maxima." t)

in your `.emacs' file.

If you want to use imath-mode, put

     (autoload 'imath-mode "imath" "Interactive Math minor mode." t)

in your `.emacs' file, too.

To do line breaking imaxima requires the LaTeX package `breqn'. This
package is officially distributed by Morten Høgholm from:
http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mh
as mh.zip. 

Alternatively, for the easy installation, you may download:
http://members3.jcom.home.ne.jp/imaxima/breqn097a.zip

The files in `breqn' must be installed in a place where TeX can find
them.  In a typical teTeX installation you should put the `*.sty' and
`*.sym' files in

     `/usr/share/texmf/tex/latex/breqn/'

and the documentation files in

     `/usr/share/texmf/doc/latex/breqn/'.

The files can also be installed in a number of other places - consult
your TeX documentation for details.

Now run `texhash' after installing the files.  You can use `kpsewhich'
to verify that TeX is able to find the files, e.g.

     kpsewhich breqn.sty

To get the best image quality a fairly recent version of Ghostscript
is recommended.  See the Info manaul for options suitable for using
older versions of Ghostscript or not using Ghostscript at all.
